This kind of biometric technology (Facial Recognition Technology) has the potential to be a really useful crime fighting tool but we are not there yet. It needs to be properly tested and evaluated if it is going to be effective and it will need to be handled carefully by the police and the government if it is going to be trusted by the public.

The previous Biometrics Commissioner made similar points as have others, such as the Science and Technology Select Committee, and we have yet to see what the government proposes as their Biometrics Strategy has been delayed for some time.

Police forces need to work together to agree on a single facial recognition system that has been proved to work in the field and government needs to create a legislative framework for its use, with independent oversight to provide public assurance, as it has done for DNA and fingerprints.

The police already hold over 20 million facial images but there is as yet no single, shared policing system for storing and searching police held images nor an evaluation of its accuracy and usefulness.

Tests of facial matching for spotting individuals in large crowds have so far had very poor success – hence the Metropolitan Police’s trial. It is good that they have made their trial public but they must carry out a proper evaluation and publish the results.

There is a public benefit in the use of such technology if it can be shown to help prevent the problems that there have been at previous carnivals by assisting the police to catch offenders or prevent crime.

Police already hold over 20 million facial images on both the Police National Database and in separate force systems. Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary (Scotland) recently commented unfavourably on this situation since it means that different standards are being applied across the UK. Most of these facial images are custody images. The courts held in 2012 that these holdings were unlawful and the Home Office responded to that judgment in 2017. I have commented on this response elsewhere.

Current police interest in facial matching has moved on from custody images to whether it can be used to identify individual offenders in public places. The capability to do this is still unproven since tests in such situations have shown very poor match rates unlike match rates in controlled environments.[1]

The police are conducting a number of trials to see if facial searching and matching technology can be employed effectively in crowded public places. Such experiments should be properly designed and evaluated, preferably involving external experts, and the results published. The police should also evaluate their use of facial images generally in order to demonstrate that they have a useful and cost-effective purpose, based on adequate matching quality. They also need to explain how they will deal with potential false matches.

There is limited research on this area and most of it has been conducted in the USA. Evaluations should include not just the behaviour of the matching algorithms but how they work in the total criminal justice system and how human decision making in such systems affects the accuracy of match rates.[2]

Facial matching systems have improved significantly recently and the use being explored by the Metropolitan Police may, at some point, reach acceptable quality for operational use but presently that remains to be demonstrated.. The controversial trial of facial recognition equipment at Notting Hill Carnival resulted in roughly 35 false matches and an 'erroneous arrest', highlighting questions about police use of the technology.

The system only produced a single accurate match during the course of Carnival, but the individual had already been processed by the justice system between the time police compiled the suspect database and deployed it.

In the days before Carnival, Sky News revealed that police have more than 20 million facial recognition images on the British public, including hundreds of thousands on innocent people.

There are a number of legal questions surrounding the police's databases, especially following a High Court ruling in 2012 which said that the retention of those images was unlawful.

Silkie Carlo, the technology policy officer for human rights group Liberty, observed the trial and described it as a "worryingly inaccurate and painfully crude facial recognition operation".

Ms Carlo explained that the 'erroneously arrested' individual was flagged up as being wanted on warrant for a rioting offence.

However, betweem the construction of the suspect database and Carnival, the individual had already been arrested and was no longer wanted.

"The project leads viewed this as a resounding success - not a failure," wrote Ms Carlo.

Independent sources have confirmed details in a blog post by Ms Carlo noting that five members of the public were flagged as suspects by the system and approached by officers to prove their identities.

The individuals had identification documents on them, but had they not they could potentially have been wrongfully arrested.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Service explained to Sky News that the "erroneously arrested" individual had not been arrested, which it defined as meaning they were taken in custody to a police station and questioned.

They said that the individual was wanted on suspicion of a public order offence and "would have been stopped by officers explaining why they were being stopped" before a radio check against the Police National Computer established that they had already been dealt with.

The Met said: "We have always maintained that it was a continued trial to test the technology and assess if it could assist police in identifying known offenders in large events, in order to protect the wider public."

"A full analysis of its deployments and a wider consultation will take place at the conclusion of the trial," the spokesperson added, although no date was given for this.

Sky sources have suggested that the Met is planning to trial the technology at other events in the future.
