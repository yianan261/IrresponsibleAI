TikTok and other social media platforms are also under pressure from U.S. lawmakers and Ukrainian officials to curb Russian misinformation about the war, especially from state-backed media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik. In response, YouTube has said it would block Russia Today and Sputnik in the European Union, while Twitter and Meta, the parent of Facebook, have said they would label content from the outlets as state sponsored.

TikTok has also banned Sputnik and Russia Today in the E.U., and on Friday said it would start labeling the outlets as state-sponsored in the countries where they are still available. The app also said on Thursday that it had dedicated more resources to monitoring for misleading content about the war.

“We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources to detect emerging threats and remove harmful misinformation,” said Hilary McQuaide, a TikTok spokeswoman. On Sunday, TikTok said it would suspend livestreaming and new content being uploaded from Russia.

For years, TikTok largely escaped sustained scrutiny about its content. Unlike Facebook, which has been around since 2004, and YouTube, which was founded in 2005, TikTok only became widely used in the past five years. Owned by China’s ByteDance, the app was designed to make one- to three-minute videos easy to create and share. It developed a reputation as a destination for addictive, silly and fun videos, especially for young users.

The app has navigated some controversies in the past. It has faced questions over harmful fads that appeared to originate on its platform, as well as whether it allows underage users and adequately protects their privacy.. A new TikTok account can be shown falsehoods about the Ukraine war within minutes of signing up to the app, according to an investigation by anti-misinformation outlet NewsGuard.

The company, which monitors the trustworthiness of news outlets across the web, ran a pair of tests to assess how the video-sharing app treated information about the conflict. It found that a new account that did nothing but scroll the app’s algorithmically curated For You Page watching videos about the war would be funnelled towards false or misleading content within 40 minutes.

“Toward the end of the 45–minute experiment, analysts’ feeds were almost exclusively populated with both accurate and false content related to the war in Ukraine – with no distinction made between disinformation and reliable sources,” the research team wrote.

“At a time when false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict are proliferating online, none of the videos fed to our analysts by TikTok’s algorithm contained any information about the trustworthiness of the source, warnings, fact-checks, or additional information that could empower users with reliable information.”

Among the false claims shown to the researchers was the myth that the US has bioweapon laboratories in Ukraine, and the accusation that Putin was “photoshopped” on to footage of a press conference he gave in early March. Videos also claimed that fake footage was real, and that real footage was fake: videos purportedly of the “Ghost of Kyiv” shooting down Russian jets were taken from a video game, while real videos from the war were decried as fake by pro-Russian accounts.

“Some of the myths in the videos TikTok’s algorithm fed to analysts have previously been identified as Kremlin propaganda,” the researchers said, by the organisation’s Russia-Ukraine Disinformation Tracking Center.

To carry out the test, NewsGuard’s research team simply made new accounts on the app and spent 45 minutes scrolling through the For You Page, stopping to view in full any video that looked like it was about the war in Ukraine.

Although TikTok does not provide a detailed breakdown of how its algorithm weighs signals, the company says it takes into account time spent watching various videos, as well as other signals including likes, comments and who a user follows or has blocked. By watching every video on the war that appeared on their page, the researchers will have “trained” the algorithm to show the new accounts content about the conflict, but not provided any specific signals in favour of misleading material.

TikTok’s search function similarly blended real and false content, delivering videos that contained false or misleading claims in the top 20 results for searches of “Ukraine”, “Russia”, “War”, “Kyiv”, and “Donbas”, NewsGuard said.

A TikTok spokesperson warned that the experiment can only offer limited conclusions about the way the app works in the real world, since it fails to mimic standard view behaviour.

“We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources as we work to remove harmful misinformation and help protect a safe experience on TikTok,” they added. “We also partner with independent fact-checking organisations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.”

The video-sharing app has had a big increase in content related to the war, with videos tagged #Ukraine receiving more than 30bn views by the end of last week. One report from the New York Times found that, proportionally, Ukraine content on TikTok outpaces that on platforms more than twice its size.. Despite its attempts to combat misinformation , TikTok is still failing to stop the spread of fake news about the Ukraine War, an anti-misinformation organization said on Monday.

Despite its attempts to combat misinformation, TikTok is still failing to stop the spread of fake news about the Ukraine War, an anti-misinformation organization said on Monday.

TikTok users are being shown videos with fake news about the war within minutes of creating new accounts, according to NewsGuard, the organization that published the report.

TikTok’s algorithm fed misinformation onto the “For You” pages of new accounts just 40 minutes after those accounts were opened, the report said, regardless of whether those individuals entered any Ukraine-related searches.

TikTok’s “For You” page is the first thing users see after they open the app. It displays a curated feed of videos that TikTok’s algorithm thinks users will like based on their interests and past interactions. Without any information at all, TikTok shows new users random popular videos.

NewsGuard also found that after searching generic terms related to the conflict, like “Ukraine” or “Donbas,” TikTok displayed multiple videos containing disinformation in its top 20 results.

NewsGuard notes the new findings add to the “body of evidence that TikTok’s lack of effective content labeling and moderation, coupled with its skill at pushing users to content that keeps them on the app, have made the platform fertile ground for the spread of disinformation.”

In response to the NewsGuard analysis, a TikTok spokesperson told Fortune, “While this experiment does not mimic standard viewing behavior, we continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources as we work to remove harmful misinformation and help protect a safe experience on TikTok.”

A TikTok war

TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has already suspended all live-streaming and new content from Russia after a Russian law took effect that increased jail time to 15 years for anyone intentionally spreading fake news about the military. It has also added digital literacy tips on its Discover page “to help our community evaluate and make decisions about the content they view online,” the company said in a statement.

But this wasn’t enough to stop fake videos from emerging on TikTok. Within 45 minutes of NewsGuard’s analysts beginning scrolling through TikTok with new accounts, their feeds would become almost exclusively populated with content related to the war in Ukraine. While some videos were accurate, no distinction was made between disinformation and reliable sources.

“At a time when false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict are proliferating online, none of the videos fed to our analysts by TikTok’s algorithm contained any information about the trustworthiness of the source, warnings, fact-checks, or additional information that could empower users with reliable information,” NewsGuard said in a statement.

The videos peddling misinformation were both pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine. Some of the examples included claims commonly used by the Kremlin to support its “special operation” in Ukraine. This includes false claims that footage of the war in Ukraine was fake or that the U.S. had bioweapon laboratories in Ukraine, a country Russia says is led by a neo-Nazi junta. Other false claims were Western oriented, such as the assertion that U.S. forces were “on the way” to Ukraine, that Putin was photoshopped into footage of a press conference to hide that he wasn’t in Moscow, and footage of a “Ghost of Kyiv” shooting down six Russian jets, which actually came from a simulator video game.

Some of the videos, like ones accusing Ukraine of being controlled by neo-Nazis, were viewed close to 2 million times.

TikTok has been used as a tool by both Russia and the West to share information about the war. The video-sharing app has seen a big increase in the amount of content related to the war, according to the Guardian, with videos that are tagged #Ukraine receiving, by the end of last week, more than 30 billion views.

There have been also reports of pro-Kremlin operatives paying Russian influencers to post propaganda on “the eight-year genocide” by the Ukrainian people in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, for which there is no reported evidence. To counter this, the Washington Post reported that the White House held a Zoom briefing with 30 TikTok stars informing them of the U.S.’s motives in Russia, asking them to debunk misinformation and communicate effectively about the crisis on the platform.. Doom scrolling down the war disinformation rabbit-hole

In March 2022, a team of six NewsGuard analysts created new accounts on TikTok and ran two experiments designed to mimic normal usage of the app. In the first experiment, analysts were instructed to scroll through TikTok’s personalized “For You” feed for 45 minutes, watching any videos relating to the Russia-Ukraine conflict in full, but not following any accounts or running any searches.

Within 40 minutes of joining TikTok, all of NewsGuard’s analysts were shown false or misleading content about the war in Ukraine.

Among these claims were both pro-Russian and pro-Ukraine falsehoods:

Falsehoods peddled by the Kremlin:



The false claim that footage from the war in Ukraine is fake

The false claim that Ukraine is led by a neo-Nazi junta

The false claim that the U.S. has bioweapon laboratories in Ukraine

The false claim that Vladimir Putin and Russia are not the aggressors in this conflict, and that the U.S. orchestrated the 2014 revolution in Ukraine

Other falsehoods:



The false claim that U.S. forces are “on the way” to Ukraine

The false claim that Putin was “photoshopped” onto footage of a press conference he gave on March 5, 2022, to hide the fact that he was not in Moscow.

Footage of Ukraine President Zelensky “out there fighting for his country,” which was actually filmed in 2021

Footage of the “Ghost of Kyiv” shooting down six Russian jets, which was actually from the Digital Combat Simulator video game

Footage of a firefight “by Ukrainian army against Russia,” which actually dates to 2015 and shows Ukrainian government troops fighting pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country.

Some of the myths in the videos TikTok’s algorithm fed to analysts have previously been identified as Kremlin propaganda in NewsGuard’s Russia-Ukraine Disinformation Tracking Center.

For example, within 29 minutes of joining TikTok, a French-speaking analyst was shown a video of a speech by Vladimir Putin claiming that “today’s neo-Nazis have taken power in Ukraine” and that responsibility for any bloodshed in the country lies with those in power in Ukraine. As of March 14, 2022, this video had been viewed 1.7 million times and shared more than 15,000 times.

Within 36 minutes, the same analyst was shown a video, published on March 5, of a man claiming that “all the images of this pseudo-war are fake. There are no images coming out of Ukraine, even Russian Spetsnaz soldiers aren’t allowed to have smartphones to film anything – so all the images you seen in the media, are fake.”

As of March 14, 2022, nine days after it was published, the video had been viewed 153,000 times.

Other videos painted a misleading picture of Ukrainian military dominance, including video-game footage purporting to show real-world images of a Ukrainian fighter jet, known as “the Ghost of Kyiv”, shooting down six Russian aircraft.

Toward the end of the 45–minute experiment, analysts’ feeds were almost exclusively populated with both accurate and false content related to the war in Ukraine — with no distinction made between disinformation and reliable sources.

At a time when false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict are proliferating online, none of the videos fed to our analysts by TikTok’s algorithm contained any information about the trustworthiness of the source, warnings, fact-checks, or additional information that could empower users with reliable information.
