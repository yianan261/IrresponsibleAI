ARTICLE TITLE: Algorithm to Distribute Social Welfare Reported for Oversimplifying Economic Vulnerability
Summary

Governments worldwide are turning to automation to help them deliver essential public services, such as food, housing, and cash assistance. But some forms of automation are excluding people from services and singling them out for investigation based on errors, discriminatory criteria, or stereotypes about poverty. Despite these harms, the allure of tech-based solutions to complex social problems is proving hard to resist.

The World Bank is one of the biggest development actors driving this trend, particularly in the Global South, placing big bets on data-intensive technologies to help governments deliver services. This includes major cash transfer programs that give certain individuals or families financial support. In the Middle East and North Africa alone, eight of ten borrowing countries have received Bank loans to upgrade these programs.

The Bank has long promoted cash transfer programs that select beneficiaries by trying to estimate their income and welfare. This approach, known as poverty targeting, has attracted intense criticism for undermining people’s social security rights, particularly in the wake of the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Poverty targeted programs are prone to error, mismanagement, and corruption, and routinely fail to reach many of the people they aim to cover. While the Bank has acknowledged these problems, it is financing a range of technologies it claims will make poverty targeting more accurate, reliable, and efficient.

This report documents the human rights impact of one such Bank-financed program in Jordan, known as the Unified Cash Transfer Program, but commonly referred to by its original name, Takaful. After screening out families that do not meet basic eligibility criteria, Takaful uses an algorithm to identify which of those remaining should receive cash transfers by ranking their level of economic vulnerability. Drawing on interviews with applicants and beneficiaries, government officials, community activists, and an analysis of World Bank documents, Human Rights Watch found that this algorithm is leading to cash transfer decisions that deprive people of their rights to social security. The problem is not merely that the algorithm relies on inaccurate and unreliable data about people’s finances. Its formula also flattens the economic complexity of people’s lives into a crude ranking that pits one household against another, fueling social tension and perceptions of unfairness.

The harms of Takaful’s targeting algorithm highlight the need for cash transfer programs based on the principles of universal social protection – providing all people with support during periods of their lives when their economic and social rights are particularly at risk, such as when they are children, face disability, become unemployed, or reach old age, and regardless of their income or wealth. On paper, the Bank has endorsed this approach as the “cornerstone of inclusive social policy.” But it continues to fund poverty targeted programs in dozens of countries, despite the wealth of policy options available to finance their transition to universal schemes.

This gap between rhetoric and practice has devastating effects on people’s rights to social security and related rights to food, health, housing, and an adequate standard of living. Although Takaful has extended regular cash assistance to 120,000 households in 2022, this is only a small fraction of the households in Jordan living under the official poverty line, which itself is an inadequate measure of the number of people unable to realize their economic, social, and cultural rights in the face of high inflation and unemployment.

The Failures of Takaful

Takaful’s complex process for evaluating who receives cash transfers begins with a questionnaire that applicants must complete. Applicants enter their name and national ID number, as well as income-related information such as wages, living expenses, and electricity and water meter ID numbers. This information is combined with data from 37 government agencies, such as vehicle registration and business licenses, employment histories, and enrollment in other social protection programs, to create comprehensive profiles of people seeking benefits.

The National Aid Fund (NAF), the Jordanian government’s social protection agency charged with implementing Takaful, told Human Rights Watch that it vets applicants in two stages. First, it assesses whether applicant households have met basic eligibility criteria, such as whether they are headed by a Jordanian citizen and living under the official poverty line. Given the program’s limited budget, however, not all eligible households become beneficiaries. Instead, NAF applies an algorithm that uses 57 socio-economic indicators to estimate their income and wealth, ranking them from least poor to poorest. The agency then selects households deemed most vulnerable to receive a limited number of cash transfers, providing them between 40 to 136 Jordanian dinars (US$56 to $192) per month.

This veneer of statistical objectivity masks a more complicated reality: the economic pressures that people endure and the ways they struggle to get by are frequently invisible to the algorithm. For example, applicant households are required to declare their income and living expenses, such as food, rent, and education. The algorithm uses the self-reported income to calculate their ranking if it is higher than the estimate based on the 57 indicators. Several people told Human Rights Watch that they could submit an application only if they declared an income that matches their living expenses. NAF disputed this, saying that people can list expenses that exceed their income by about 20 percent.

Either restriction fails to recognize how people struggle to make ends meet, or their reliance on credit, support from family, and other ad hoc measures to bridge the gap.

“The questions asked don’t reflect the reality we exist in,” said Abdelhameed, a father of two who makes 250 dinars a month ($353) working at a coffee shop in Amman. “My rent is 140 dinars [$197]. My phone, electricity and water bills, and other living expenses are 320 dinars [$451]. My income is less than my expenses, but I had to match it on the application. Each month, we just trust in Allah and hope we can cover our expenses. Some months, my siblings abroad help out.”

Like many others whom Human Rights Watch interviewed, Abdelhameed eventually learned that he was able to submit the application if he lowered his expenses to match his income. Forcing people to mold their hardships to fit the algorithm’s calculus of need, however, undermines Takaful’s targeting accuracy, and claims by the government and the World Bank that this is the most effective way to maximize limited resources.

This is one of several dubious criteria that Takaful’s algorithm uses to distinguish between people who are selected for transfers and those who are notified that they are “not among the poorest.” The algorithm may infer that households are less vulnerable the more water and electricity they consume, under an indicator that measures dwelling characteristics. The value of an old family car, a small business, or livestock also affects the family’s ranking.

These measures of vulnerability trap people in impossible choices between the realization of their right to social security and other economic and social rights, such as their rights to a decent living, health, and food. Some people told Human Rights Watch that owning a car could have been one of the reasons they were rejected from Takaful, even though they needed it for work, or to transport water and firewood. “The car destroyed us,” said Mariam, a resident of al-Burbaita village in the southern governorate of Tafilah, one of the poorest villages in the country. Her family received Takaful cash transfers in 2021 but was dropped from the program in 2022. “We use it to transport water and for other needs. But sometimes we don’t have the money to fill it up with diesel, so we walk to the street and wait for someone to pass by and agree to pick us up,” she added.

Human Rights Watch also found that the algorithm reinforces gender-based discrimination. Its calculation of household size, one of the measures of vulnerability, only considers the number of Jordanian members in the household. This formula artificially shrinks the size of households headed by Jordanian women with noncitizen spouses and children because the law does not recognize their right to pass on citizenship to these family members on an equal basis with men, lowering their benefit payments or excluding them from the program entirely. Women in male-headed households are not spared from gendered design choices either: awarding Takaful payments to heads of households, who in Jordan are usually regarded as the husband or father, rather than individual adult members, heightens dependency on male family figures and unduly restricts women’s access to benefits.

Takaful also offers lessons on the importance of reconciling the ambition of migrating government services online with the realities of the digital divide. The online application is daunting for people who lack internet access and digital literacy. “Who needs money?” said Aseel, a 29-year-old worker at a plastics factory in Amman who has benefited from Takaful and helped many other families apply. “The people who really don’t know how [to apply] or don’t have internet or computer access.”

NAF has mobilized its offices and set up temporary registration centers around the country to help people apply for the benefit. But people who are unable to access these resources, or who do not know someone familiar with the application process like Aseel, often end up paying a fee to submit their application through mobile phone shops or maktabehs – stores that sell office supplies, children’s toys and printing and internet services, and have now become a regular port of call for people struggling to navigate the requirements of the poverty-targeted scheme. These businesses also help people cash out benefit payments from their e-wallets – the main payment method that both the government and the World Bank have promoted as an effort to increase financial inclusion.

These online transactions impose hidden costs that cut into an already meagre benefit. Misha’al, 36, tried to apply for Takaful on his own, but the online portal was loading too slowly on his phone. He paid 2 dinars ($2.82) to travel by bus to a maktabeh about 35 kilometers away from his home to submit his application. The maktabeh charged another 3 dinars ($4.23) for the service. When his application was approved, Misha’al paid a mobile phone shop another 3 dinars to withdraw his benefit, on top of the administrative fee of half a dinar ($.70) levied by the e-wallet company. These fees reduced his family’s monthly benefit from 101 ($142) to 92.5 dinars ($130).

In response to these findings, the Bank said that Takaful is “amongst the most redistributive and cost-effective poverty reduction programs currently active in Jordan,” and part of a broader set of programs dedicated to advancing universal social protection in the country. It emphasized that information systems and technology can “facilitate” the delivery of social protection programs, but “are not substitutes” for interactions between institutions and people.

NAF said that the algorithm’s 57 indicators are designed to measure “multi-dimensional poverty,” and that none of them would, on their own, exclude a household from Takaful. Instead, each of these indicators is assigned a certain weight stipulating their relative importance in the targeting process. For example, households with cars that are more than five years old would be less likely to qualify for cash transfers than households that do not own cars, all else being equal. However, the agency acknowledged that owning a car less than five years old or a business worth 3,000 dinars or more ($4,231) would automatically exclude families from the program.

NAF also confirmed that it requires applicants to declare living expenses that are no more than about 2o percent of their income, because many of them had previously declared they had no income but high expenses. It also emphasized that people have multiple ways to apply for Takaful: online, at one of NAF’s 68 branches or 290 registration centers, or through a mobile registration vehicle that makes stops in rural areas.

NAF declined to disclose the full list of indicators and the specific weights assigned to each indicator, saying that these were for internal purposes only and “constantly changing.”

Key Recommendations

Establishing a universal social protection system in Jordan will address many of the problems identified in this report and provide lasting and meaningful protections for people’s rights, including their rights to social security and privacy. Universal programs, such as benefits for all children or for people that reach retirement age, remove the need for subjective and error-prone assessments of people’s income and welfare, and the intrusive data collection practices required for these assessments. They also simplify eligibility requirements, easing the burden of applying while improving transparency and accountability. The social protection consultancy Development Pathways has estimated that introducing a modest package of universal child, disability and old age benefits in Jordan will cost 280 million dinars ($394.9 million), or less than 1 percent of GDP, during the first year of the program, and increase to slightly above 2 percent by 2035.

A shift in the government’s approach could help many individuals and families break the cycle of precarity and poverty. “If the government is in front of me right now, it would be useful for them to feel the life pressures we feel living in Jordan,” Aseel said. “Everyone has to juggle several jobs. I don’t have time to see my family anymore. I don’t have time to tell my mom how I’m doing because I am too busy. I don’t see my friends anymore because I’m too busy working… people are just so desperate.”

Recommendations

To the World Bank and other development banks:

Cease developing, pursuing, supporting, or recommending the use of algorithmic decision-making to estimate, rank, or score people’s financial welfare and allocate cash transfers based on these evaluations.

Conduct and publish algorithmic audits on all Bank-financed programs that use algorithmic decision-making.

Ensure that all audits, including the 2023 evaluation of the Takaful targeting algorithm, declare the algorithm’s value weighting and decision-making criteria.

Ensure that audits examine the rate of exclusion errors, the reasons for such errors, and corrective measures taken; the adequacy of privacy and data protection safeguards to mitigate the risk of data breaches and leakages and inaccuracies in personal data held by the relevant government agencies; and the right to appeal eligibility decisions.

Focus financing and technical assistance on modernizing information systems that are critical to securing universal social protection, such as population registries and vital statistics databases, and ensure that such assistance is provided in a manner consistent with privacy and related human rights standards.

For existing social protection loans with poverty targeting objectives, work with borrower governments to revise objectives and budget allocations to prioritize establishing policies and infrastructure that are in line with the Bank’s own vision to achieve universal social protection by 2030.

Build on the Bank’s 2022 Social Protection and Jobs sector strategy to develop concrete commitments to universal social protection, expanding financing and technical assistance for social protection schemes that cover various life course contingencies, such as universal child benefits, maternity benefits, and pension schemes for all people aged 65 and above.

In countries with limited fiscal space, advocate for categorical schemes that may be initially restricted in scope (for, e.g., a universal child benefit that targets all children under a certain age, provided a strategy is put in place to progressively expand the scheme to target all children below the age of 18).

Ensure that social protection programs are designed to meet individual rather than household needs and provide benefits to the individual rather than the head of household.

Identify and take concrete steps to address the impact of the digital divide on access to social protection.

To the Government of Jordan:

Cease using the Proxy Means Testing-based targeting algorithm and methodology to allocate cash transfers and reconfigure Takaful’s infrastructure, including the National Unified Registry, to support the rollout of universal social protection schemes that provide support to individuals rather than households.

Shift social protection strategy from poverty targeting to schemes that cover all people when they are most at risk in life, such as a child benefit that provides Pprotection during and after childbirth and an old age benefit that protects people during retirement age.

Adopt categorical schemes that may be initially restrictive in light of fiscal constraints, provided there is a concrete strategy and timeline in place to expand these programs to become truly universal (e.g., providing a universal child benefit for all children under a certain age, with the goal of expanding the benefit to cover all children under 18, as well as the benefit amount to an adequate level).

During the transition period between poverty-targeted and universal social protection schemes, adopt interim measures to expand and improve Takaful, such as by expanding coverage to families of people with temporary Jordanian passports, non-citizen spouses, and children of Jordanian women.

Publish all 57 indicators that the targeting algorithm uses to estimate household income, as well as the weights assigned to each indicator.

Publish the 2023 evaluation of the targeting algorithm as well as yearly audits of the targeting algorithm for as long as it is operational, ensuring that such audits disclose any changes in the value weighting and decision-making criteria, the rate of exclusion errors, the reasons for such errors, and corrective measures taken.

Make public all previous findings regarding inclusion and exclusion error rates associated with Takaful’s targeting method, and steps taken to address these errors.

Publish data that will enable meaningful public scrutiny of Takaful’s effectiveness at reaching people living in poverty, including the 2017-2018 Household Expenditure and Income Survey datasets.

Increase public awareness of the appeals process and the right to appeal through media and public campaigns as well as in-person outreach.
