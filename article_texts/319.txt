Derrick Monet is suing Tesla after a 2019 accident where the Tesla Model 3 he was driving slammed into the rear of a firetruck in Putnam County, Indiana.

The Model 3 was running on Autopilot at the time of the accident. The suit alleges that the Autopilot system failed to prevent the accident.

His wife, Jenna Monet, died in the accident. At the same time, Derrick suffered multiple fractures in his neck, ribs and femur.

According to the police report, the Tesla failed to take any evasive action. However, the plaintiff says Tesla and multiple unnamed entities that manufactured the Model 3 caused the crash, injuries and damages.

In addition, the lawsuit references a government investigation opened in August 2021 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, reports CarComplaints.

The NHTSA opened the investigation after several accidents between Tesla’s on Autopilot and parked emergency vehicles. In total, there have been 12 reported accidents.

Moreover, Tesla provided an over-the-air software update to help Autopilot systems detect flashing emergency lights on parked vehicles.

Tesla, for its part, notes that it is the driver’s responsibility to stay alert, drive safely and be in control of the vehicle at all times.

The company is also working with the NHTSA on their active investigation.

Tesla did not comment on the pending suit filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California (Derrick Monet, v. Tesla Inc., et al.). Follow us today...

Tesla's long-running list of crashes involving its vehicles smashing at full-speed into the rear end of parked first responder vehicles has a new tragic footnote. The latest killed the passenger-side occupant of the vehicle. This latest crash happened this past Sunday morning December 29th, 2019. The accident occurred at 8:00 am in the morning, in dry conditions and in broad daylight. The crash took place on Route I-70 in Indiana. This is the second crash of a Tesla vehicle into a parked firetruck in just this month.

Note: Where are the images? We have opted not to post the images of the crash scene since it involved a fatality. You can view them here if you wish.

We are no longer certain of the exact number of Tesla cars that have smashed into the rear of parked first responder vehicles, the accident list now becoming difficult to manage due to frequency. However, by our estimate, this is the sixth such crash. It is the first we know of that involved the death of an occupant in the Tesla vehicle. However, other crashes have of course resulted in fatalities on many occasions.

Indiana police say that drugs and alcohol are not considered to be a cause of this accident at this time. Police also have not yet said if this crash involved the use of Tesla's Autopilot driver-assist system, often referred to by many as "self-driving" technology. Torque News will update this story if a determination as to Autopilot's involvement is made.

Police say the following are the known circumstances surrounding this latest crash:

"A 2019 Tesla, driven by a Derrick N. Monet, age 25, of Prescott Valley, Arizona, failed to observe the emergency vehicle positioned in the passing lane of I-70, running into the back of the parked fire truck. Derrick Monet and a passenger, his wife, Jenna N. Monet, age 23, also of Prescott Valley, Arizona, received serious injuries from the impact. Both occupants had to be extricated and were transported to the hospital for immediate medical care. Jenna Monet later succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced deceased at Terre Haute Regional Hospital."

As with the many previous crashes, no first responder was injured in this Tesla crash. Below is a partial list of previously reported stories related to Tesla vehicles crashing into the rear of parked first responder vehicles:

There is no word yet on whether the NTSB will investigate this newest Tesla crash into a firetruck. The agency has investigated prior crashes of this type. We will update our story if the agency opts to look closely at this crash. Media reports on a second fatal crash this same day do confirm that federal investigators are looking into that incident.

Why does Torque News report on Tesla crashes of this type? For two reasons. First, these crashes are unusual and newsworthy since they appear to be almost identical and may be caused by a self-driving system Tesla is evolving into what it refers to as "full-self-driving." Second, in anticipation of a Tesla Autopilot death of a first responder which we feel poses the possibility to bankrupt this public company. In June of 2018, Torque News interviewed an MIT researcher working with Tesla to evaluate Autopilot safety from big data. He told us (on video) "We know there is an issue with the detection of static objects."

Torque News has reached out to Tesla for more details on this crash and asked specifically if Autopilot was being used at the time of the crash. If we receive any added information we will edit this story and indicate the update.
