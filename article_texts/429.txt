Silvon Simmons case: Judge tosses conviction of man accused of shooting at cop
In a courtroom full of blue, with dozens of uniformed Rochester police officers watching, a judge Thursday reversed the criminal conviction of a man once accused of attempting to murder a city police officer.

County Court Judge Christopher Ciaccio decided that a key piece of the prosecution's case —  the city's crime-fighting tool known as ShotSpotter — was not reliable enough. While the tool, which attempts to alert police to gunshots, may be viable in cases with other corroborating evidence of a crime, it became the linchpin of the case against Silvon Simmons, Ciaccio ruled.
"This case did not have buttressing evidence," Ciaccio said. 

In late October a jury acquitted Simmons of the 2016 attempted murder of a police officer, Joseph Ferrigno, who was chasing him on foot. The jury did convict Simmons of the criminal possession of a weapon that was found near Simmons, whom Ferrigno shot three times. Ferrigno alleged that he returned fire after Simmons shot at him.
The case in some ways was a microcosm of the strained relations between police and some lower-income neighborhoods in the city. Activists pushing for tougher oversight of police portrayed the incident as a rogue cop shooting an innocent man; Simmons ran from police after being mistaken for someone else the police were looking for.

Rochester police, meanwhile, saw the shooting episode as a reminder of the hazards faced daily by cops in a city where illegal guns are legion and people willing to use them are plentiful. 
But what became the centerpiece of the evidence against Simmons, as well as the centerpiece of Ciaccio's decision to reverse the weapons possession conviction, were the questions of the ShotSpotter evidence, which provided audio support of Ferrigno's version of the shooting.

Simmons was scheduled to be sentenced Thursday, but Ciaccio sided with Simmons' defense, who asked that the lone weapons possession conviction be reversed because of the ShotSpotter evidence.

ShotSpotter is contracted by localities across the country, including Rochester. The company sets up microphones with transmitters attached, and they're located at different elevated spots around high-crime areas. ShotSpotter officials then alert police to possible shooting locations.

Assistant Public Defender Elizabeth Riley, one of Simmons' attorneys, argued that ShotSpotter had denied the defense evidence that could have raised more questions about the shooting. The city contracts with ShotSpotter for about $130,000 annually. Riley in court portrayed the relationship as one in which "a multi-million corporation preserved what (evidence) the customer wanted."
Assistant District Attorney Julie Hahn, one of the prosecutors in the case, said that ShotSpotter had reviewed its audio from the shooting, and found nothing else worthy of relaying to the prosecution or defense. The audio included five audible bursts; Ferrigno fired four times and said Simmons fired at him first with a single shot.
Hahn said Ferrigno has not been able to return to work because of the trauma of the incidence, and his family has suffered too. Ferrigno was cleared of any wrongdoing in an internal investigation.

"There's no consideration whatsoever given the officer," she said after Ciaccio's ruling. 

After the ruling, Simmons continued to maintain his innocence. 

"I just thank God," he said. " ... I still got shot for nothing."
At the trial, Ferrigno and another officer who was the first on the scene after the shooting testified about the incident. The defense highlighted inconsistencies in the testimony, which the prosecution said were minor.

However, Ciaccio said, the jury clearly "discredited" the testimony; otherwise it likely would have convicted Simmons of the more serious charge. And, over four days of deliberations, the jury returned multiple times to listen to the ShotSpotter audio, and its apparent five audio bursts.
The case was originally with another judge, who denied a defense request for a broad subpoena of ShotSpotter records. ShotSpotter provided eight seconds of audio, obtained from different sensors around Immel Street, where the shooting occurred.

Initially the automated system did not recognize the sounds as gunfire, deciding it was instead likely an overhead helicopter. After the city requested that ShotSpotter review the audio, company officials decided there were at first three, then four, then five shots.
That subjective determination raised questions about the reliability of the ShotSpotter evidence, Ciaccio said. And, Riley contended, the lack of audio before or after those eight seconds hindered the defense. There may well have been other audio bursts that could have shown there were other noises picked up by the sensors, Riley said.
Hahn countered that ShotSpotter officials thoroughly reviewed the audio evidence and would have provided proof of any other sounds, had there been others.

Hahn said that Ciaccio's decision may be appealed. There is also the possibility of a retrial on the weapons possession charge, but that would likely have to go forward without the ShotSpotter evidence.
Defense attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have the ShotSpotter evidence disallowed at the trial. The Innocence Project even joined in, filing its first brief raising questions about ShotSpotter.

The Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization that works to free the wrongly convicted, highlighted in its brief what it said was the subjective nature of ShotSpotter evidence.

"While this technology may have advanced to the point where its data can be used as an investigative tool, it is not sophisticated enough to generate data that is reliable enough to be admitted as 'scientific' evidence in a criminal trial," the Innocence Project's Dana Delger wrote in her brief.

Ciaccio said that the science behind ShotSpotter may be reliable enough when it is partnered with other evidence. But that was not the case with the Simmons' shooting, he said.

"The ShotSpotter testimony was crucial," Ciaccio said.
