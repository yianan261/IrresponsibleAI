Sports Illustrated accused of passing AI articles off as human-created content

The publisher of Sports Illustrated has ousted its chief executive officer following public backlash over the sport's magazine's alleged use of AI to write stories.

The Arena Group's termination of CEO Ross Levinsohn came as the media giant's board members met on Monday to consider measures to "improve [the company's] operational efficiency and revenue," the company said Monday in a statement posted on its website. The decision comes after SI became steeped in public controversy over allegations it used AI to generate content and fictitious author bios for its website.

The alleged AI-generated content was first reported by tech-focused publication Futurism. According to a post by a spokesperson for Arena Group on SI's X account in November, the questionable content included articles and product reviews from AdVon Commerce, a third-party content provider.

"AdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans," the X post read.

Stories removed from site

Though it denied the report that the famed publication produced articles written by artificial intelligence, Arena Group pulled the alleged AI-generated stories from SI.com pending an ongoing internal investigation.

Arena Group did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.

Manoj Bhargava, the 5-Hour Energy founder who owns a majority stake in Arena Group, was named the company's interim CEO on Monday, according to the company's statement.

Levinsohn stepped into the CEO role at Arena Group — which owns more than 250 brands reaching more than 100 million readers — in 2020, his LinkedIn profile shows. He has held senior leadership roles at HBO and CBS Sportsline, in addition to serving as Yahoo's interim CEO in a career that spans three decades, according to the profile.

Arena Group's latest firing follows three terminations at the company last week, including that of COO Andrew Kraft, media president Rob Barrett and corporate counsel Julie Fenster.

The company's shares were trading more than 5% lower on Tuesday as of 2 p.m. EST.. NEW YORK (AP) — Computer-generated writers ... writing computer-generated stories?

Sports Illustrated is the latest media company to see its reputation damaged by being less than forthcoming — if not outright dishonest — about who or what is writing its stories at the dawn of the artificial intelligence age.

The once-powerful publication said it was firing a company that produced articles for its website written under the byline of authors who apparently don’t exist. But it denied a published report that stories themselves were written by an artificial intelligence tool.

Earlier this year, experiments with AI went awry at both the Gannett newspaper chain and the CNET technology website. Many companies are testing the new technology at a time when human workers fear it could cost jobs. But the process is fraught in journalism, which builds and markets its values-based products around the notions of truth and transparency.

While there’s nothing wrong in media companies experimenting with artificial intelligence, “the mistake is in trying to hide it, and in doing it poorly,” said Tom Rosenstiel, a University of Maryland professor who teaches journalism ethics.

“If you want to be in the truth-telling business, which journalists claim they do, you shouldn’t tell lies,” Rosenstiel said. “A secret is a form of lying.”

CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS OF WHAT HAPPENED

Sports Illustrated, now run as a website and once-monthly publication by the Arena Group, at one time was a weekly in the Time Inc. stable of magazines known for its sterling writing. “Its ambitions were grand,” said Jeff Jarvis, author of “Magazine,” a book he describes as an elegy for the industry.

On Monday, the Futurism website reported that Sports Illustrated used stories for product reviews that had authors it could not identify. Futurism found a picture of one author listed, Drew Ortiz, on a website that sells AI-generated portraits.

The magazine’s author profile said that “Drew has spent much of his life outdoors, and is excited to guide you through his never-ending list of the best products to keep you from falling to the perils of nature.”

Upon questioning Sports Illustrated, Futurism said all of the authors with AI-generated portraits disappeared from the magazine’s website. No explanation was offered.

Futurism quoted an unnamed person at the magazine who said artificial intelligence was used in the creation of some content as well — “no matter how much they say that it’s not.”

Sports Illustrated said the articles in question were created by a third-party company, AdVon Commerce, which assured the magazine that they were written and edited by humans. AdVon had its writers use a pen name, “actions we don’t condone,” Sports Illustrated said.

“We are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership,” the magazine said. A message to AdVon wasn’t immediately returned on Tuesday.

In a statement, the Sports Illustrated Union said it was horrified by the Futurism story.

“We demand answers and transparency from Arena group management about what exactly has been published under the SI name,” the union said. “We demand the company commit to adhering to basic journalistic standards, including not publishing computer-written stories by fake people.”

NOT THE FIRST SUCH SITUATION

Gannett paused an experiment at some of its newspapers this summer in which AI was used to generate articles on high school sports events, after errors were discovered. The articles carried the byline “LedeAI.”

Some of the unpleasant publicity that resulted might have been avoided if the newspapers had been explicit about the role of technology, and how it helped create articles that journalists might not have been available to do, Jarvis said. Gannett said a lack of staff had nothing to do with the experiment.

This past winter, it was reported that CNET had used AI to create explanatory news articles about financial service topics attributed to “CNET Money Staff.” The only way for readers to learn that technology was involved in the writing was to click on that author attribution.

Only after its experiment was discovered and written about by other publications did CNET discuss it with readers. In a note, then-editor Connie Guglielmo said that 77 machine-generated stories were posted, and that several required corrections. The site subsequently made it more clear when AI is being used in story creation.

“The process may not always be easy or pretty, but we’re going to continue embracing it, and any new technology that we believe makes life better,” Guglielmo wrote.

Other companies have been more up front about their experiments. Buzzfeed, for example, attributed a travel article on Santa Barbara, Calif., to writer Emma Heegar and Buzzy the Robot, “our creative AI assistant.”

“We’ll be developing content that is AI-native — cool new things that you couldn’t do at all without AI — and things that are enhanced by AI but created by humans,” Buzzfeed said in a note to readers.

The Associated Press has been using technology to assist in articles about financial earnings reports since 2014, and more recently in some sports stories. At the end of each such story is a note that explains technology’s role in its production, a spokeswoman said.

For instance, a short article about an upcoming NBA matchup earlier this month had this note at the end: “The Associated Press created this story using technology provided by Data Skrive and data from Sportradar.”

The Arena Group, publisher of Sports Illustrated, has fired the magazine’s CEO not long after it was revealed Sports Illustrated had published articles written by fake authors with AI-generated headshots and biographies.

The Arena Group’s board announced on Monday that CEO Ross Levinsohn had his employment terminated, with Manoj Bhargava named as interim chief executive. The board said it followed a meeting on actions to “improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company”.

The release did not mention the AI scandal from November, which was spurred by an investigative report published by the science and technology news publication Futurism.

Among fake profiles uncovered by Futurism was that of purported author “Sora Tanaka” which claims she is a product reviewer. The page said: “Sora has always been a fitness guru, and loves to try different foods and drinks. Ms Tanaka is thrilled to bring her fitness and nutritional expertise to the Product Reviews Team, and promises to bring you nothing but the best of the best.”

Tanaka is not a real person.

The Arena Group, which acquired Sports Illustrated in 2019, denied the allegations, and said the articles in question were sourced commercial content from a third-party advertising company, AdVon Commerce.

A spokesperson for the Arena Group wrote in a statement at the time: “Today, an article was published alleging that Sports Illustrated published AI-generated articles. According to our initial investigation, this is not accurate.

“A number of AdVon’s e-commerce articles ran on certain Arena websites. We continually monitor our partners and were in the midst of a review when these allegations were raised. AdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans … However, we have learned that AdVon had writers use a pen or pseudo name in certain articles to protect author privacy – actions we strongly condemn – and we are removing the content while our internal investigation continues and have since ended the partnership.”

The company cut ties with AdVon and removed its content from Arena websites.

Sports Illustrated, first published in 1954, is known as well for its swimsuit issues, often featuring covers of fashion models, athletes and other celebrities in bikinis. But, as Futurism noted, it also once published contributions from famed writers such as William Faulkner and John Updike.

After a round of layoffs earlier this year, Levinsohn indicated that Sports Illustrated would incorporate AI into its journalism, but said it would never replace journalism.

“While AI will never replace journalism, reporting, or crafting and editing a story, rapidly improving AI technologies can create enterprise value for our brands and partners,” Levinsohn said in February.

Last week Arena terminated the employment of operations president and COO Andrew Kraft, media president Rob Barrett, and corporate counsel Julie Fenster.

Bhargava is the founder of the company behind the 5-Hour Energy Drink product.. The publisher of Sports Illustrated, The Arena Group, announced Monday that its CEO, Ross Levinsohn, has been terminated in the latest round of firings at the company in the wake of an artificial intelligence scandal.

Levinsohn will be replaced in the interim by Manoj Bhargava, the founder and CEO of Innovations Ventures, known for creating the 5-hour Energy drink, The Arena Group said in a statement.

A reason for Levinsohn’s termination was not shared. The company said its board “took actions to improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company.”

The company terminated operations president and chief operating officer Andrew Kraft, media president Rob Barrett and corporate counsel Julie Fenster last week.

Sports Illustrated fell into hot water last month after an article on the science and tech news site Futurism accused the former sports news giant of using AI-generated content and author headshots without disclosing it to their readers.

The authors' names and bios did not connect to real people, Futurism reported.

When Futurism asked The Arena Group for comment on the use of AI, all the AI-generated authors disappeared from the Sports Illustrated website. The Arena Group later said the articles were product reviews and licensed content from an external, third-party company, AdVon Commerce, which assured it that all the articles were written and edited by humans and that writers were allowed to use pen names.

Neither last week's Arena Group firings nor Levinsohn's termination addressed the AI controversy.
