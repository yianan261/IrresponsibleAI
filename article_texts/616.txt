ARTICLE TITLE: Sports Illustrated Is Alleged to Have Used AI to Invent Fake Authors and Their Articles
The shock waves from Sports Illustrated’s unethical use of AI-generated content, which last week led to some top-level executives at the media outlet’s parent company being canned, have apparently claimed an even bigger victim.

That news came yesterday as The Arena Group, which publishes SI, fired its CEO, Ross Levinsohn. In a statement, the company did not mention the recent AI fiasco and said the move was made “to improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company,” but we can all connect the dots.

Earlier in his career, Levinsohn faced multiple workplace accusations of sexual harassment and creating a “frat house environment.” Although an internal review cleared him, he admitted under oath that he ranked the “hotness” of female colleagues and openly speculated about whether one female co-worker had a side job as a stripper and/or had slept with another co-worker. That didn’t keep The Arena Group from letting him serve as their CEO — until now.

Levinsohn will be replaced on an interim basis by The Arena Group’s majority owner, Manoj Bhargava, who purchased a 65% stake in the company in August after making his fortune as the founder of the dietary supplement 5-Hour Energy. As you may recall, Bhargava introduced himself to the SI newsroom last week in a “meandering video call” in which he reportedly insulted the staff and went off on a rant about recycling.

Neil Leifer could not be reached for comment.. The chief executive of Sports Illustrated magazine has been sacked after claims it ran articles by fake authors generated using artificial intelligence.

The Arena Group, the magazine’s publisher, said it had fired Ross Levinsohn in an attempt to “improve the operational efficiency and revenue of the company”.

It made no reference to an investigation by Futurism, a tech news website, last month that found Sports Illustrated had published articles generated by AI, with headshots of fake journalists attached.

The publisher denied that it had used AI to produce articles, claiming the content had been created by a third party advertising company, AdVon Commerce. It said the fictitious names attached to the stories were pseudonyms, not AI-generated personas.

The investigation found a profile page of a product reviewer, Sora Tanaka, who does not exist but was described as a journalist who “has always been a fitness guru, and loves to try different foods and drinks”.

Fake name attached to a headshot

Another article about volleyball was purportedly written by Drew Ortiz, which Futurism claimed was a fake name attached to an AI-generated headshot.

The publisher said at the time: “Today, an article was published alleging that Sports Illustrated published AI-generated articles. According to our initial investigation, this is not accurate.”

The company said it would sever ties with AdVon Commerce over its unauthorised use of pseudonyms.

Mr Levinsohn’s departure will see Manoj Bhargava, an Indian businessman, step in as interim CEO before the post is filled. It follows rounds of layoffs, including in February, when 17 staff lost their jobs.

Sports Illustrated, launched in 1954, became the first magazine to reach a circulation of one million readers and become known for its annual “swimsuit issue”, featuring women wearing bathing costumes on its cover.

The magazine was sold in 2019 to Maven, a digital media company that has since rebranded to The Arena Group.
