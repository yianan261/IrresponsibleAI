You may very well get a call in the near future from a relative in dire need of help, asking you to send them money quickly. And you might be convinced it’s them because, well, you know their voice.

Artificial intelligence changes that. New generative A.I. tools can create all manner of output from simple text prompts, including essays written in a particular author’s style, images worthy of art prizes, and—with just a snippet of someone’s voice to work with—speech that sounds convincingly like a particular person.

In January, Microsoft researchers demonstrated a text-to-speech A.I. tool that, when given just a three-second audio sample, can closely simulate a person’s voice. They did not share the code for others to play around with; instead, they warned that the tool, called VALL-E, “may carry potential risks in misuse…such as spoofing voice identification or impersonating a specific speaker.”

But similar technology is already out in the wild—and scammers are taking advantage of it. If they can find 30 seconds of your voice somewhere online, there’s a good chance they can clone it—and make it say anything.

“Two years ago, even a year ago, you needed a lot of audio to clone a person’s voice. Now…if you have a Facebook page…or if you’ve recorded a TikTok and your voice is in there for 30 seconds, people can clone your voice,” Hany Farid, a digital forensics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Washington Post.

‘The money’s gone’

The Post reported this weekend on the peril, describing how one Canadian family fell victim to scammers using A.I. voice cloning—and lost thousand of dollars. Elderly parents were told by a “lawyer” that their son had killed an American diplomat in a car accident, was in jail, and needed money for legal fees.

The supposed attorney then purportedly handed the phone over to the son, who told the parents he loved and appreciated them and needed the money. The cloned voice sounded “close enough for my parents to truly believe they did speak with me,” the son, Benjamin Perkin, told the Post.

The parents sent more than $15,000 through a Bitcoin terminal to—well, to scammers, not to their son, as they thought.

“The money’s gone,” Perkin told the paper. “There’s no insurance. There’s no getting it back. It’s gone.”

One company that offers a generative A.I. voice tool, ElevenLabs, tweeted on Jan. 30 that it was seeing “an increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases.” The next day, it announced the voice cloning capability would no longer be available to users of the free version of its tool VoiceLab.

Fortune reached out to the company for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.

“Almost all of the malicious content was generated by free, anonymous accounts,” it wrote. “Additional identity verification is necessary. For this reason, VoiceLab will only be available on paid tiers.” (Subscriptions start at $5 per month.)

Card verification won’t stop every bad actor, it acknowledged, but it will make users less anonymous and “force them to think twice.”. A couple in Canada reportedly lost $21,000 from a scammer claiming to be a lawyer and their son.

Benjamin Perkin told The Washington Post his parents thought the AI-generated voice was him.

The rise of AI is making it easier for scammers to make people think they're talking to loved ones.

A couple in Canada were reportedly scammed out of $21,000 after they received a call from someone claiming to be a lawyer who said their son was in jail for killing a diplomat in a car accident.

Benjamin Perkin told The Washington Post the caller put an AI-generated voice that sounded like him on the phone with his parents to ask for money. The alleged lawyer called his parents again after the initial call, and told them Perkin needed $21,000 for legal fees before going to court.

Perkin told the Post the voice was "close enough for my parents to truly believe they did speak with me."

His parents collected the cash and sent the scammer money through Bitcoin, Perkin said, but they later admitted they thought the phone call sounded strange. They realized they had been scammed after Perkin called to check in later that evening.

Perkin did not immediately respond to a reachout from Insider to discuss what happened.

He told the Post his family filed a police report with Canadian authorities, but that, "The money's gone. There's no insurance. There's no getting it back."

The Post reported that while Perkin doesn't know how the scammers found his voice, he has posted videos about snowmobiling on YouTube.

The rise of more powerful AI tools is coinciding with a rise in scams involving people impersonating other people. The most commonly reported scam last year was imposter scams, the Federal Trade Commission found. The FTC saw fraud reports from 2.4 million people in 2022, which was lower than in 2021. However, the amount of money lost was higher, with $8.8 billion reported lost.

Scams involving AI technology predate the emergence of ChatGPT and other AI bots going viral right now. In 2019, the managing director at a British energy company reportedly wired over $240,000 to an account in Hungary after he thought his boss asked him to do so in a phone call.

In January, ElevenLabs, a research lab exploring voice cloning and tools for synthetic speech, shared a Twitter thread addressing people who "use our tech for malicious purposes."

The startup tweeted that it was releasing a tool to let people verify if an audio sample was made using the company's technology, and that its VoiceLab would only be accessible with payment.

A day before writing the thread, ElevenLabs tweeted that it was aware of "an increasing number of voice cloning misuse cases," after releasing its Beta platform.

Motherboard found that members on the anonymous site, 4chan, were using ElevenLabs' technology to generate voices that sound like celebrities to say racist and inappropriate things.

The FTC has created a new Office of Technology to investigate the potential uses of AI that companies are promising, and to see if companies are mitigating the risks their products can cause.

"We're also concerned with the risk that deepfakes and other AI-based synthetic media, which are becoming easier to create and disseminate, will be used for fraud," FTC spokesperson Juliana Gruenwald previously told Insider.

Gruenwald also told Insider that the FTC "has already seen a staggering rise in fraud on social media."

"AI tools that generate authentic-seeming videos, photos, audio, and text could supercharge this trend, allowing fraudsters greater reach and speed," she said.. TL;DR AI voice-generating software is allowing scammers to mimic the voice of loved ones.

These impersonations have led to people being scammed out of $11 million over the phone in 2022.

The elderly make up a majority of those who are targeted.

AI has been a central topic in the tech world for a while now, as Microsoft continues to infuse its products with ChatGPT and Google attempts to keep up by pushing out its own AI products. While AI has the potential to do some genuinely impressive stuff — like generating images based on a single line of text — we’re starting to see more of the downside of the barely regulated technology. The latest example of this is AI voice generators being used to scam people out of their money.

AI voice generation software has been making a lot of headlines as of late, mostly for stealing the voices of voice actors. Initially, all that was required was a few sentences for the software to convincingly reproduce the sound and tone of the speaker. The technology has since evolved to the point where just a few seconds of dialogue is enough to accurately mimic someone.

In a new report from The Washington Post, thousands of victims are claiming that they’ve been duped by imposters pretending to be loved ones. Reportedly, imposter scams have become the second most popular type of fraud in America with over 36,000 cases submitted in 2022. Of those 36,000 cases, over 5,000 victims were conned out of their money through the phone, totaling $11 million in losses according to FTC officials.

One story that stood out involved an elderly couple who sent over $15,000 through a bitcoin terminal to a scammer after believing they had talked to their son. The AI voice had convinced the couple that their son was in legal trouble after killing a U.S. diplomat in a car accident.

Like with the victims in the story, these attacks appear to mostly target the elderly. This comes as no surprise as the elderly are among the most vulnerable when it comes to financial scams. Unfortunately, the courts have not yet made a decision on whether companies can be held liable for harm caused by AI voice generators or other forms of AI technology.

Bail Out

Ruthless scammers are always looking for the next big con, and they might've found it: using AI to imitate your loved ones over the phone.

When a 73-year-old Ruth Card heard what she thought was the voice of her grandson Brandon on the other end of the line saying he needed money for bail, she and her husband rushed to the bank.

"It was definitely this feeling of... fear," Card told The Washington Post. "That we've got to help him right now."

The couple withdrew the maximum of 3,000 Canadian dollars at one bank and went to another for more. Fortunately, a vigilant bank manager flagged them down and warned them that another customer had gotten a similar phone call that sounded like it was from a loved one — but it turned out the voice had been faked.

"We were sucked in," Card said. "We were convinced that we were talking to Brandon."

Legal Trouble

Not all were as lucky. The 39-year-old Benjamin Perkin told WaPo how his elderly parents were swindled out of thousands of dollars with the help of an AI impersonator.

Perkin's parents had received a phone call from a lawyer, who claimed that their son killed a US diplomat in a car crash and needed money for legal fees. The apparent lawyer then let Perkin speak on the phone — and the voice sounded just like him.

This convinced them. When the lawyer later called back asking for CAD $21,000, his parents went to the bank and sent the money through BitCoin.

"The money's gone," Perkin told the paper. "There's no insurance. There's no getting it back. It's gone."

Easy Pickings

Voice cloning scams have been a threat for several years now. But the growing ubiquity of powerful and easy-to-use AI means that the technology's potential to be abused easily outpaces an unwitting public's ability to keep up with the tricks of bad actors — not realizing they could be targeting them already.

"Two years ago, even a year ago, you needed a lot of audio to clone a person's voice," Hany Farid, a professor of forensics at UC Berkeley, told WaPo. "Now... if you have a Facebook page... or if you've recorded a TikTok and your voice is in there for 30 seconds, people can clone your voice."

Take ElevenLabs, whose AI voice synthesis service costs as little as $5 per month, and can produce results so convincing that a journalist used it to break into his own bank account. It's even spawned an entire genre of memes impersonating President Joe Biden. ElevenLabs' voice cloning has only been around since 2022. Imagine the damage it — and competitors looking to ride the coattails of its success — could do in just a few more years.
