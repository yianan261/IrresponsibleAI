The Moscow metro has rolled out what authorities have lauded as the world’s first mass-scale facial recognition payment system, amid privacy concerns over the new technology.

The cashless, cardless and phoneless system, named Face Pay, launched at more than 240 stations across the Russian capital on Friday.

“Now all the passengers will be able to pay for travel without taking out their phone, metro or bank card,” the Moscow mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, tweeted on Thursday evening.

To activate Face Pay, Sobyanin said, passengers will need to connect their photo, bank card and metro card to the service through the metro’s mobile app. “It will be enough just to look at the camera to pass through the turnstiles,” Sobyanin said.

The Moscow authorities, who expect up to 15% of metro passengers will use Face Pay regularly in the next three years, said the system would quicken the flow of people, particularly at busy times.

“Moscow is the first in the world to introduce Face Pay on such a scale. The technology is new and very complex, we will continue to work on improving it,” the mayor added.

Authorities have said passengers’ data will be “securely encrypted”, saying the information collected will be stored in data processing centres to which only interior ministry staff have access.

However, activists have raised the alarm over privacy concerns. “This is a dangerous new step in Russia’s push for control over its population. We need to have full transparency on how this application will work in practice,” said Stanislav Shakirov, the founder of Roskomsvoboda, a group dedicated to protecting digital rights and freedom of information.

“We are moving closer to authoritarian countries like China that have mastered facial technology. The Moscow metro is a government institution and all the data can end up in the hands of the security services,” he added.

Moscow recently expanded its facial recognition technology across the capital, with a network of more than 175,000 surveillance cameras.

Human rights activists said the cameras were used to identify protesters who attended rallies in support of the jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny. Facial recognition was also used to enforce Covid-19 quarantines during Russia’s two-month lockdown in spring 2020.

The Russian metro – the busiest in Europe, with more than 6 million daily passengers – is considered a tourist attraction in itself, with stations elaborately decorated with mosaics reflecting a range of Soviet themes.. Special Rapporteur on racism, Tendayi Achiume, presented her concerns in a report delivered on Wednesday to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

Tech ‘not neutral’

“Technology is not neutral or objective”, said Ms. Achiume, who was appointed by the Council and is neither a UN staff member nor paid by the Organization.

“It is fundamentally shaped by the racial, ethnic, gender and other inequalities prevalent in society, and typically makes these inequalities worse. It is resulting in discrimination and unequal treatment in all areas of life, from education and employment to healthcare and criminal justice.”

While extremist racism, xenophobia and intolerance are at issue, the problem runs much deeper, according to the rights expert.

“Corporations such as Facebook, have economic and business models that mean they actively profit from misinformation, discrimination and intolerance”, she said, adding that many governments have adopted algorithms which discriminate against marginalised groups.

‘Transnational uprising’

In addition to pressing for reparations for those affected by entrenched racism, Ms. Achiume also called for possibly banning some technologies.

“The deaths of George Floyd and countless others have prompted a transnational uprising against systemic racism in law enforcement,” she said, referring to the African American man who died in May while in police custody on a street in Minneapolis.

“Part of the human rights response must include greater scrutiny of how the design and use of digital technologies is further entrenching this systemic racism.”

With her report released against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit racial and ethnic minorities the hardest, Ms. Achiume warned that technology deployed to combat spread of the disease “is the same type that has been used to exclude these communities from full enjoyment of their human rights in the past”.

More representation

To prevent and eliminate racial discrimination in technological design will require having more racial and ethnic minorities in decision-making in the industry, Ms. Adichie said.

“States must also provide the full spectrum of effective remedies for those against whom emerging digital technologies have racially discriminated”, she added.

“This includes accountability for racial discrimination, and reparations to affected individuals and communities. As recent moves to ban facial recognition technologies in some parts of the world show - in some cases the discriminatory effect of digital technologies will require their outright prohibition.”
