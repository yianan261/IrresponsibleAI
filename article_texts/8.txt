Uber's San Francisco trial run of its self-driving service last Tuesday is catching people's attention. Unfortunately, it might not exactly be the kind of hype that Uber hoped for. As previously noted, the ride-hailing service company's autonomous vehicle test drive in its hometown was given a red light by the California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

To make things even more interesting, Uber's self-driving cars were caught beating non-metaphorical red lights on two separate occasions — and in both instances, the vehicles seemed to be the Volvo XC90, launched the same day as Uber's test run.

Here's the video of the erring Uber captured by Charles Rotter, operations manager at traditional cab company Luxor.

According to an Uber spokesperson, “These incidents were due to human error. This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers. The drivers involved have been suspended while we continue to investigate.”

The incident was also witnessed by San Fransico writer and producer Annie Guas as she was travelling by a (human piloted) Lyft. She sounded off on Twitter:

As there are no current laws governing self-driving cars in the San Fransisco area, there is little consensus on what could or would be done. When a police officer was asked about the incident she stated, “First comes technology, then comes policy. It’s going to be a matter of setting some precedents,” said officer Giselle Talkoff, adding, “The companies that are putting these vehicles on the road should have their vehicles operate with due regard to the rules of the road.”. An Uber equipped to drive itself ran a red light in San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood Wednesday morning, per a YouTube video apparently shot from a local Luxor cab and reported by The Examiner:

In the video, a Volvo XC90 SUV decked out in the sensors Uber uses to see the world plowed through the intersection roughly three seconds after the light went red, and as a pedestrian was stepping into the crosswalk. In a statement, Uber spokesperson Chelsea Kohler said the car was being operated by its human driver at the time and had no passengers aboard, and that Uber has suspended that driver while it investigates. 2

Even if it was a human at the wheel, it’s bad news on the day Uber announced it’s welcoming passengers aboard its fleet of driverless cars in the city, and that it’s doing so without filing for an autonomous testing permit with the California DMV. Declining to do that likely means Uber doesn’t have to publicly report things like crashes and “disengagements”—when the human operator takes control to make sure the car operates safely.

In a letter sent to Uber self-driving chief Anthony Levandowski on Wednesday afternoon, California DMV counsel Brian Soublet said that if Uber does not immediately confirm it will stop testing and seek a permit, the DMV will take legal action and seek an injunction. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. 3

Science Climb Inside Uber’s Self-Driving Car—Its Next Big Disruption

The ride-sharing giant is in Pittsburgh for its latest big move: the country’s first autonomous taxi service. Select Uber users can now ride in self-driving cars, with humans at the wheel for an emergency.

1 Story updated at 19:00 on December 14 with new information. 2 Story updated at 19:11 on December 14 to include Uber’s statement that the car was being driven by a human at the time of the incident. 3 Story updated at 19:20 on December 14 to include letter from California DMV.. An autonomous Uber malfunctioned while in “self-driving mode” and caused a near collision in San Francisco, according to a business owner whose account raises new safety concerns about the unregulated technology launch.

The self-driving car – which Uber introduced without permits, as part of a testing program that California has deemed illegal – accelerated into an intersection while the light was still red and while the automation technology was clearly controlling the car, said Christopher Koff, owner of local cafe AK Subs.

“It looked like the car ran the red light on its own,” Koff, 49, said of the self-driving Uber Volvo, which has a driver in the front seat who can take control when needed. Another car that had the green light had to “slam the brakes” to avoid a crash, he said.

Koff’s story, which advocacy group Consumer Watchdog shared with state officials on Tuesday, directly contradicts Uber’s public claims that red-light violations have been the result of “human error” and that the drivers, not the technology, have failed to follow traffic laws.

The new allegations – which Uber denied and which cover an incident three weeks ago – have come to light days after the corporation openly refused to adhere to California regulations, claiming that its defiance of government was an “issue of principle”.

Uber’s autonomous cars were first spotted on San Francisco streets in September, but the company formally launched a pilot program to riders last week. California officials have repeatedly said the ride-sharing corporation, which is headquartered in San Francisco, needs testing permits, noting that 20 other companies have followed protocols.

But Uber has ignored attorney general Kamala Harris’s threat of legal action, claiming it does not need permits since the vehicles have drivers monitoring and citing the cars’ “state-of-the-art” technology and “core safety capabilities”.

Koff’s account, however, suggests that the products may not be ready for the road and that safety mechanisms are insufficient.

It was around 5am local time, and Koff said he was standing 10ft away from the vehicle when he saw it stopped at a light. While the driver was talking to a passenger, who had a laptop out, the car suddenly drove forward into the red, according to Koff. The driver’s hands were not on the wheel, he added.

“He was not driving. It was in self-driving mode,” said Koff. He noted that it was foggy at the time and that there were construction trucks nearby shining yellow lights that could have possibly interfered with the technology.

It would not be the first time the computer in a self-driving vehicle made a basic error with potentially life-threatening consequences.

In May, the “autopilot sensors” on a Tesla Motors car failed to distinguish a white tractor-trailer crossing the highway against a bright sky, leading to the first known death caused by a self-driving car.

Uber also admitted to the Guardian on Monday that its San Francisco cars have a “problem” with the way they cross bike lanes, and the company’s self-driving cars in Pittsburgh have reportedly collided with other cars and driven the wrong way on a street.



Spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler declined to provide details about Koff’s claims and sent the Guardian a statement identical to the one she provided last week, citing “human error”, adding: “This is why we believe so much in making the roads safer by building self-driving Ubers.”

Kohler did not respond to questions about how the company knows the driver was at fault and whether he faced consequences. Last week, she said two drivers had been suspended after the self-driving vehicles had been recorded running red lights.

Critics have argued that regardless of whether violations occur in self-driving mode or while a human is in control, Uber needs to be responsible for dangers posed by its cars – and should be embracing regulators, not shunning them.

“Someone could be hurt or maimed or paralyzed for the rest of their life because we’re trying to rush something out there,” said Koff, noting that he also recently saw a driver in an autonomous Uber scramble to take control when it was trying to navigate around a nearby bus and an approaching ambulance.

John M Simpson, privacy project director for Consumer Watchdog, who filed a report based on Koff’s incident, said he suspects Uber does not want to follow regulations that would require it to disclose details about errors to the government.

“Being able to understand the traffic signal and respond appropriately is a key requirement of any so-called self-driving technology,” said Simpson, who has called for criminal charges against Uber. “It obviously failed that test.”.

SOMA, SAN FRANCISCO — Uber isn’t exactly known for following the rules. The ride-sharing company recently launched its self-driving car service in San Francisco without the necessary permits with the DMV, unlike self-driving car manufacturers like Google, Tesla, and General Motors who had abided by state regulations. But this week, a San Francisco cab driver captured video of an Uber self-driving car running a red light, sparking outrage from local activists.

In a press conference earlier today, Uber announced its plans to continue operating the cars despite their history of violations. Uber spokesperson Eric Bauer decried traffic lights as “onerous government regulation… that is not applicable to us and should not be enforced.”

“Traffic lights, like other so-called ‘road safety’ regulations, are just examples of the complex rules and requirements that could have the unintended consequence of slowing innovation,” said Mr. Bauer, despite the fact that every other human and self-driving car learned to obey traffic signals before even being allowed to drive on the road. “This isn’t about picking a fight. This is about getting regulators to do the right thing, which is whatever we want.”

At first, Uber blamed the red-light-running issues on human error: errors of the human programmers who coded the bug to run the red lights and errors of the human safety monitors who did not turn off the cars’ self-driving mode before they ran through the red lights. Compared to Google/Waymo’s overly polite but safe self-driving cars, Uber cars have also been caught recklessly turning across bike lanes, running stop signs, and failing to yield to pedestrians.

However, Uber soon noticed that the behavior had reduced ride times in its experimental self-driving car fleet by up to 35%. Instead of fixing the supposed problems, Uber is now planning to “roll out” this “improved” behavior to its vast fleet of human drivers. “We here at Uber are committed to optimizing experience and efficiency for our customers,” said Mr. Bauer. “And last time I checked, pedestrians aren’t customers.”

During the press conference, one reporter expressed concern that Uber’s plans would run afoul of state and federal regulations for safe driving. Mr. Bauer reportedly laughed and responded, “Of course it will disrupt regulations. But screw the rules, we have money!”

UPDATE (12/23/2016): Soon after the press conference above, the California DMV irately revoked the registrations of 16 of Uber’s self-driving test cars, saying that, “the registrations were improperly issued for these vehicles because they were not properly marked as test vehicles.” In response, Uber put out a press release saying that they would halt all autonomous vehicle testing in San Francisco and move to the “Objectivist paradise of Arizona.”

A spokesperson argued, “red lights are coercive and stifle the free marketplace of ideas. There, we will not be subject to arbitrary limits like stop signs, as the more enlightened Arizona state government correctly prioritizes freedom and innovation over petty trivialities like safety.”
