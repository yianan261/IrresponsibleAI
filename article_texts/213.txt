ARTICLE TITLE: Facebook’s Political Ad Detection Reportedly Showed High and Geographically Uneven Error Rates
PARIS (AFP) - Facebook misidentified tens of thousands of advertisements flagged under its political ads policy, according to a study released Thursday (Dec 9), which warned that the failure could lead to political manipulation.

Researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven university and New York University examined 33.8 million Facebook ads that ran on the social media site between July 2020 and February 2021.

"This is the first known study to quantify the performance of Facebook's political ad policy enforcement system at a large and representative scale," the team said in a summary of their findings.

Facebook imposes stricter conditions on paid advertisements that concern "social issues, elections or politics", including posts that promote particular candidates.

Ads labelled as political appear on the site with a disclaimer that explains who paid for them. Ads that are found to be political, when they were not declared as such, are taken down.

But the researchers found that in 189,000 cases when Facebook reviewed an ad to check whether or not it should be treated as political, it was wrong 83 per cent of the time.

These included 117,000 cases when Facebook's detection system failed to flag up ads that should have been treated as political, and 40,000 ads that were mistakenly flagged as political when they were not.

The researchers noted that Facebook's enforcement of the policy relies heavily on detecting keywords in ads under an automated system, although staff also play a role in moderating the content.

The period studied included elections in two large Facebook markets, the United States and Brazil, and the researchers warned that mislabelling the ads created opportunities for manipulation.

"When Facebook fails to identify advertisers who do not properly declare their ads as political, those who are malicious can spread disinformation," they warned.

"Users who see ads without a political disclaimer may not be aware that their intent is to influence them," they added.

The team noted that the US social media giant missed a higher proportion of undeclared political ads outside the US.

"The platform had the worst record in Malaysia, where it missed as much as 45 per cent of ads from obviously political pages or advertisers," the research summary said.

"In Macedonia, Argentina, Turkey, Portugal, France and Serbia, Facebook missed up to one out of four ads from such pages, which were sponsored by candidates or parties." The study follows criticism of Facebook over a recent whistleblower scandal, including accusations that the site's ability to tamp down hate speech and misinformation has been seriously lacking outside the West.

Within the US, Facebook introduced a moratorium on political ads around the 2020 presidential election, following deep controversy over the platform's role leading up to the 2016 election of Mr Donald Trump.

Facebook nonetheless allowed more than 70,000 political ads to run during the 2020 moratorium, the researchers found.

AFP has reached out to Facebook to request a comment on the study.. In the years since the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how easily Facebook’s political ads could be weaponized by bad actors abroad, the social network has made some major overhauls that, in a perfect world, would keep a scandal like that from happening again. It rolled out an ever-growing library of the ads political parties were running on its platform, put up a new authorization process for anyone looking to run political ads in the U.S., and even let users opt out of seeing some of those ads if they chose.

These tools largely rely on advertisers being honest about disclosing their political ties, though—and tho se folks aren’t known for being honest. Facebook knows this, which is why it also uses a (mostly automated) review process to sniff out political ads that might be trying to skirt these rules.

Because these systems are, again, mostly automated, things go about as well as you’d expect: S tories have come out describing political groups openly skirting attempted ad crackdowns, and of regular mom- and- pop shops whose ads got slapped with a political label.

Now a joint study between researchers at New York University and KU Leuven in Belgium suggests that that this problem might be worse than we thought. The team investigated 189,000 political ads that ran on Facebook between July 2020 and February of this year, and found that Facebook had missed the mark a whopping 83%(!) of the time: 21% were regular ads for products that the platform had misidentified as being political, and the remaining 62% were outright political ads that Facebook just... missed.

If you’re familiar with Facebook’s less-than-stellar reputation when it comes to moderating content written in non-English languages, you won’t be surprised to hear that the lion’s share of these misses came from overseas.

In Malaysia, for example, the researchers found nearly half of the political ads they collected—45% —weren’t labeled, despite being run by blatantly political advertisers or pages. Pages from Macedonia, Argentina, and Turkey, meanwhile, had about a quarter of their political ads fly under Facebook’s radar. The U.S., meanwhile, had something of the opposite problem: about 55% of the political ads that Facebook had flagged weren’t political at all; the examples compiled on the researchers’ site include ads for products like a Ford pickup and a baby cradle being branded as “political.”

Of course, there are some major misses in the U.S., too. The tracking both of these teams were doing coincided with Facebook’s temporary ban on political ads following last year’s presidential election. The researchers found more than 70,000 political ads running wild on the platform during this period, by pages that had openly run nothing but political ads before the ban began—the only thing that changed is that they weren’t labeled anymore. And Facebook just didn’t notice.

We’ve reached out to Facebook about the study and will update here when we hear back.
