MANILA, Philippines – A new study published this month by NewsGuard, a US-based site helmed by journalists that track online misinformation, found about 20% of search results delivered by TikTok contain misinformation.

The site made use of new TikTok accounts to perform the searches in order to preserve neutrality. They searched for a variety of topics using neutral phrases including the US “2022 election”; ”mRNA vaccine” in relation to COVID-19; “January 6 FBI” in relation to the US Capitol riot on the said date in 2020; and “Uvalde tx conspiracy” in relation to the May 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

NewsGuard found that of the 540 TikTok results they gathered from the top 20 results from 27 searches, a total of 105 videos contained false or misleading claims. The number of search results with misinformation comprised 19.4% of the total.

The site also found that TikTok would also automatically suggest misleading search terms when a user enters a neutral term. TikTok would suggest terms such as “climate change debunked” and “climate change doesn’t exist” when they searched for “climate change,” and “covid vaccine exposed” or “covid vaccine hiv” when they searched for “covid vaccine.”

The group also noted that Google’s search results were “more straightforward,” with results such as “walk-in covid vaccine” or “which covid vaccine is best” when searching for “covid vaccine.” They also noted TikTok’s search results were “more polarizing than Google’s.

“For example, 12 out of the top 20 search results for ‘2022 midterm’ contained hyper-partisan, left-leaning rhetoric. The caption of one video presented as a search result referred to 2022 Georgia Republican US Senate candidate Herschel Walker as as a ‘vegetable,’ while a person in another video proclaimed all Republicans to be “mother*uckers.”

The findings come amid TikTok’s rising popularity for searches especially for Gen Z, often defined as those born from 1997 to 2012. “The toxicity of TikTok has become a significant threat because new research from Google suggests TikTok is increasingly being used by young people as a search engine, as they turn to the video-sharing platform, instead of Google, to find information,” said NewsGuard.

NewsGuard sought TikTok for their comments regarding the findings, and a TikTok spokesperson referred to the platform’s community guidelines, which they said “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”



The site, however, said TikTok did not make direct answers to specific queries such as who decides how TikTok’s search engine algorithm feeds users results; whether TikTok’s search engine algorithm is tailored to prevent it from feeding users misinformation, and how, if so; and why TikTok’s search function prompt users to search for things that are misleading. – Rappler.com.

“Aloha, beloved,” says a smiling woman, against the backdrop of her kitchen. “About three, four days ago I made ‘the cure’ … to what’s going around. It’s actually called hydroxychloroquine,” she explained, referring to the drug that ignited fierce debate soon after the coronavirus pandemic began, when, following multiple studies, a broad consensus of medical experts, including the FDA, rejected claims that it could prevent or cure COVID-19, even as some, including then-President Donald Trump, continued to tout it.

The young woman lifts up a plastic jug containing a murky yellow liquid. “It’s made out of grapefruit peel and lemon peel and it’s slow simmered and it’s supposed to ‘cure’ that,” she continues. “I’m telling you, hydroxychloroquine, quinine, can heal anything.”

The video is the second one that appears when users — perhaps curious about a drug that is still being promoted by some diehards on sketchy internet outlets — search for the term “hydroxychloroquine” on TikTok. Indeed, in the top 20 results for that search, four videos that pop up promoted recipes for a do-it-yourself version of hydroxychloroquine — a prescription drug used to treat malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis that can only be produced in controlled laboratory settings and is dangerous when not taken as prescribed.

Although the hydroxy chef in the kitchen video never used the word COVID, perhaps because that might have attracted TikTok’s word-search-based content moderators, her promise that it can cure “what’s going around,” and “can heal anything” was clear, and, in fact potentially more dangerous given the promise that it can heal not just COVID, but “anything.”

As with this video inspiring viewers to whip up a dangerous drug in their kitchens, a NewsGuard investigation found that TikTok’s users, who are predominantly teens and young adults, are consistently fed false and misleading claims when they search on TikTok for information about prominent news topics.

The NewsGuard investigation found that for a sampling of searches on prominent news topics, almost 20 percent of the videos presented as search results contained misinformation. This means that for searches on topics ranging from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to school shootings and COVID vaccines, TikTok’s users are consistently fed false and misleading claims.

Asked for comment about these findings, a TikTok spokesperson said that TikTok’s Community Guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”

According to TikTok’s publicly available Community Guidelines Enforcement Report, in the first quarter of 2022, TikTok removed more than 102 million videos for violating its Community Guidelines. Less than one percent of these were removed for violating TikTok’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines — which, according to TikTok’s Community Guidelines, includes “harmful misinformation,” defined as “misinformation that causes significant harm to individuals, our community, or the larger public regardless of intent.” (NewsGuard sent six false or misleading videos to TikTok on Sept. 9. All were removed by TikTok by Sept. 12.)

On its website, TikTok states that newly uploaded videos automatically go through a round of AI-driven review. If the AI detects an issue, the video is either removed or sent to a human moderator for further review, the guidelines state.

The toxicity of TikTok has become a significant threat because new research from Google suggests that TikTok is increasingly being used by young people as a search engine, as they turn to the video-sharing platform, instead of Google, to find information. In 2021, TikTok surpassed Google as the most popular website worldwide, according to the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare. The Wall Street Journal in August referred to TikTok as the “new Google.” As a headline last month in the trade publication Ad Week put it, “Move Over Google. TikTok the Go-To Search Engine for Gen Z.”

NewsGuard’s findings come as TikTok faces increased scrutiny over its moderation and data- collection practices, including its ties to China. TikTok is owned and operated by ByteDance, a Chinese internet conglomerate partially owned by the Chinese government. Despite being owned by a Chinese company, TikTok is banned in China, even as its influence spreads across Western democracies.

Searching for information, finding misinformation

In September 2022, four U.S.-based NewsGuard analysts contrasted search results on TikTok and Google to find information about the 2020 presidential election, COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, abortion, and school shootings, among other topics in the news. (As explained in the Methodology section below, these searches were done using new TikTok accounts to ensure search results were not influenced by prior user activity on the platform.) TikTok — whose library of user-generated videos can be easily searched by typing in keywords in its search bar — repeatedly delivered videos containing false claims in the first 20 results, often within the first five. Google, by comparison, provided higher-quality and less-polarizing results, with far less misinformation.

NewsGuard analyzed 540 TikTok results, based on reviewing the top 20 results from 27 searches on news topics. Of the search results, NewsGuard found that 105 videos — 19.4 percent — contained false or misleading claims. These search terms included neutral phrases, such as “2022 election” and “mRNA vaccine,” as well as searches that might be used to learn more about controversial news topics, such as “January 6 FBI” and “Uvalde tx conspiracy.” Many of these charged phrases were suggested by TikTok’s search bar when NewsGuard typed in the neutral phrases.

For example, when a user enters the term “climate change,” TikTok suggests searches for “climate change debunked” and “climate change doesn’t exist.” For a user who searches for “covid vaccine,” TikTok suggests a search for “covid vaccine injury,” “covid vaccine truths,” “covid vaccine exposed,” “covid vaccine hiv,” and “covid vaccine warning.” A search for “Jan 6” yields suggestions for videos proclaiming “Jan 6 footage being let in” and “Jan 6 antifa,” among others.

In contrast, Google suggested search terms that were more straightforward. For example, searching “covid vaccine” on Google prompted “walk-in covid vaccine,” “which covid vaccine is best,” and “types of covid vaccines.” None of these terms was suggested by TikTok.

Even when TikTok’s search results yielded little to no misinformation, the results were often more polarizing than Google’s. For example, 12 out of the top 20 search results for “2022 midterm” contained hyper-partisan, left-leaning rhetoric. The caption of one video presented as a search result referred to 2022 Georgia Republican U.S. Senate candidate Herschel Walker as a “vegetable,” while a person in another video proclaimed all Republicans to be “mother*uckers.”
