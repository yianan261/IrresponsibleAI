. The man killed in the first known fatal crash of a self-driving car may have been watching one of the Harry Potter films when the collision happened.

According to the driver of the truck Joshua Brown's car crashed into, the man was "playing Harry Potter on the TV screen," at the time.

Frank Baressi also told the Associated Press that Brown "went so fast through my trailer I didn't see him".

He added: "It was still playing when he died and snapped a telephone pole a quarter mile down the road".

The driver was killed while using "autopilot" mode in a Tesla S sports car on May 7 in Williston Florida.

According to Reuters, a portable DVD player was found in the vehicle.

Tesla said in a statement that Brown was a "friend to Tesla and the broader EV community".
