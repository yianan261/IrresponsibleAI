CANTON, Ohio — Joshua Brown loved his all-electric Tesla Model S so much he nicknamed it Tessy.

And he celebrated the Autopilot feature that made it possible for him to cruise the highways, making YouTube videos of himself driving hands-free. In the first nine months he owned it, Mr. Brown put more than 45,000 miles on the car.

“I do drive it a LOT,” he wrote in response to one of the hundreds of viewer comments on one of his two dozen Tesla-themed videos. His postings attracted countless other Tesla enthusiasts, who tend to embrace the cars with an almost cultish devotion.

They also tend to be people who like to live on technology’s leading edge, which in Mr. Brown’s case meant dismantling bombs for the Navy during the Iraq war, then coming home to start his own company to extend internet service into rural America. In his spare time he used a 3-D printer to make model tanks and trucks.. Driver Joshua D. Brown had previously posted a near-miss on YouTube involving his Tesla Model S and a truck

ROBO-CAR HORROR Former Navy Seal who became first person to die in a self-driving car was ‘watching Harry Potter when his Tesla smashed into a truck’

THE former Navy Seal who became the first person to die in a self-driving car crash was reportedly watching a Harry Potter film when his Tesla vehicle smashed into a truck.

Joshua D. Brown, 40, from Ohio, died on May 7 in Williston Florida when his Tesla Model S failed to distinguish between the side of a white turning truck and the bright sky meaning the breaks did not automatically activate while in auto-pilot.

Truck driver Frank Baressi, 62, whose vehicle ploughed into Brown's high-tech motor, said the former soldier was "playing Harry Potter on the TV screen" and "he went so fast through my trailer I didn't see him."

He said: "It was still playing when he died and snapped a telephone pole a quarter mile down the road.”

The death in Florida is thought to be the first human fatality in a driverless car and could potentially trigger a recall if the vehicles are found to be unsafe.

Brown died at the scene from injuries sustained in the crash.

There is still no confirmation whether Brown, who died at the scene of the smash, was watching the family movie on a screen in his vehicle or on a mobile device.

Tech company Tesla insist that drivers are not able to watch films or television shows on the car's touchscreen.

The initial police report did not contain any references to the victim watching a film.

Initial reports say that the crash occurred when Baressi’s truck turned left in front of the Tesla at the intersection with no traffic lights.

Firefighters found Brown’s fancy motor hundreds of feet from the crash site with its roof completely seared off.

Emergency services pronounced the former SEAL dead at the scene and respectively covered the wreck before crash investigators arrived.

Tesla said that this is the first known death in over 130 million miles of Autopilot operation.

The innovative company admits the system is an "assist feature" which requires the driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all times.

Drivers are told they need to "maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle" and should be ready to take control at any time.

Brown served as a Navy SEAL for 11 years and also founded wireless internet and camera company Nexu Innovations Inc.

The Pentagon also confirmed the driver’s work with the SEALs and said he left the elite fighting team in 2008.

The former soldier was a huge admirer of Tesla and his 2015 Model S which he nicknamed ‘Tessy’.

Just a month before the crash, he credited Tesla's Autopilot for saving him in a near-miss caught on video.

He wrote: "Tessy did great. I have done a lot of testing with the sensors in the car and the software capabilities.

"I have always been impressed with the car, but I had not tested the car's side collision avoidance. I am VERY impressed. Excellent job Elon!"

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has since opened a "preliminary evaluation" on the company's Autopilot feature.

Elon Musk, product-architect of Tesla Motors, paid tribute to Brown on Twitter.

Tesla said in a statement it was the first fatality in more than 130 million miles where the autopilot feature had been activated.

The company added the crash had taken place in "extremely rare circumstances."

Their statement reads: "What we know is that the vehicle was on a divided highway with Autopilot engaged when a tractor trailer drove across the highway perpendicular to the Model S.

"Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.

"The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.

"Had the Model S impacted the front or rear of the trailer, even at high speed, its advanced crash safety system would likely have prevented serious injury as it has in numerous other similar incidents."

Tesla launched its Autopilot programme last October, which marked the company's first foray into self-driving technology.

While the Model S tells drivers to keep their hands on the wheel, the car is mostly able to navigate itself in clear highway conditions with sensors keeping track of highway lines and surrounding cars.

The death and subsequent investigation could put a dent in Tesla's shares, already reeling from Musk's proposed acquisition of SolarCity.

There’s a new small detail but important development in the investigation of the fatal Tesla Model S crash while the Autopilot system was activated. We now learn that the Florida Highway Patrol confirmed that both a laptop and DVD player were found in the car, but that neither were running when found at the scene.

Sergeant Kim Montes confirmed the details to Reuters today:

“Neither the computer nor a DVD player also found in the vehicle was running after the crash, according to Sergeant Kim Montes, who said investigators could not determine whether the driver of the Tesla was operating either at the time of the crash.”

It goes against what the truck driver involved in the crash told the media after the accident. Speaking with Associated Press, Frank Baressi said the Tesla driver, Joshua Brown, was “playing Harry Potter on the TV screen” at the time of the crash and driving so quickly that “he went so fast through my trailer I didn’t see him.”

“It was still playing when he died and snapped a telephone pole a quarter mile down the road,” Baressi told The Associated Press. He later acknowledged that he couldn’t actually see the movie and only heard it. The police said that charges are pending against Baressi who didn’t yield the right of way when crossing the road in his semi-tractor trailer. In an ABC News report, another witness said that “a movie was playing on the dash”: NHTSA said that its evaluation of the accident is on-going.

Tesla Autopilot crash: Images of the fatal accident’s aftermath emerge [Video]

Understanding the fatal Tesla accident on Autopilot and the NHTSA probe. In May 2016, the inevitable happened: A Tesla driver was killed in a crash while his car was on Autopilot, the company’s impressive yet controversial semiautonomous driving software.

Tesla and authorities reported at the time that the Model S had “passed under” a semitrailer that had been making a left turn across traffic on a Florida freeway, with the trailer shearing the top off the car. But other details were sketchy, including how fast the Tesla had been going, how the driver failed to see the semitruck in broad daylight, and whether the vehicle’s Autopilot system had warned the driver in any way. The truck driver told the Associated Press that he had heard what sounded like a movie blaring from the car after it came to a rest farther down the highway.

This week, the National Transportation Safety Board cleared up some lingering questions when it published the factual findings of its investigation into the crash. The driver had indeed been going hands-free—and not just a little bit. According to the 538-page report, the driver had been using Autopilot for 37 minutes, out of which he had placed his hands on the wheel for a grand total of just 25 seconds. This despite seven separate visual warnings from the system, which flashed the message, “Hands required not detected.” Clearly the driver was determined to use Autopilot as if it were a fully autonomous driving system, rather than the safety mechanism that Tesla says it is meant to be.

However, reports that the driver had been watching a Harry Potter movie, perhaps on an in-dash DVD player, appear to have been unfounded. The NTSB’s main witness to the crash, who saw the car up close after it came to a stop, said there was no audio or video entertainment system playing. (The truck driver who had told the AP he thought he heard a movie playing in the car admitted he was not close enough to the vehicle to see anything or to be certain of what he heard.)

We may never know what the Model S driver was paying attention to instead of the road at the time of his fatal accident. We do know that he took no evasive action whatsoever. The NTSB report says he had set the software to a cruising speed of 74 mph shortly before the crash, and it was apparently still going that speed when the car hit the truck’s trailer broadside.

Interestingly, that suggests the truck driver could have foreseen the crash—if he had assumed the car would maintain a constant speed. The witness said the Model S was visible to the truck over the crest of a rise in the freeway for “several seconds” before the truck began its left turn. The implication is that the driver either didn’t see the Model S coming or assumed—perhaps naturally, given the truck’s size and visibility—that the Tesla’s driver would brake or change lanes to avoid the collision. That seems like a safe assumption when the driver is human but perhaps less so when the driver is an automated system. (Samuel English Anthony wrote compellingly last year about some of the expectations problems that can arise when autonomous systems and human drivers share the road.)

To be clear, this is conjecture: The truck driver declined to be interviewed by the NTSB and reportedly claimed to the Florida Highway Patrol that he didn’t see the Tesla coming. Still, it points to one of the big problems for autonomous driving systems, which is that their behavior might be logical on paper yet surprising to other drivers accustomed to sharing the road with fellow humans.

The NTSB report does not yet offer any analysis or conclusions as to who was at fault in the crash. That will come in a follow-up to this factual presentation of the evidence. However, Reuters reports that the truck driver has been charged with a right-of-way violation and is due to appear in court Wednesday.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded its own investigation in January without finding that Tesla’s Autopilot system was a safety hazard. In fact, it estimated that the software reduces the likelihood of an accident by 40 percent, which is a compelling statistic in Tesla’s favor. But that was a broader probe of the system’s overall safety more than it was an assessment of the specifics of the fatal Florida crash. (I reported last August on one particularly dramatic instance in which the system may have saved a driver who suffered a pulmonary embolism while at the wheel.)

So what can we take away from the fatal accident now that a year has passed and key facts have been established?

First, it was a sobering reminder that autonomous driving software, for all its impressive achievements, remains far from perfect. Tesla’s Autopilot may have saved more lives than it has cost, but there are still circumstances in which it is prone to error in ways that an attentive human driver never would be.

Second, Tesla’s Autopilot system was (and remains) a work in progress, and it’s clear in retrospect that it was released to the public without safety features that could have helped to prevent at least one death. To its credit, Tesla was quick to address two major deficiencies that the crash highlighted. First, it modified the software so that it will stop working if the driver repeatedly ignores warnings to take the wheel. Second, it tweaked the driving system itself to allow automatic emergency braking in cases where the radar detects an obstacle but the computer vision system doesn’t. These changes have likely decreased the chances of an accident happening in just this way again.

Finally, the fact that the driver seems to have blithely ignored seven visual warnings underscores what some critics had charged all along: that Tesla’s warning system seemed more like a fig leaf to cover its legal liability than a genuine deterrent to hands-free driving. It was apparent from the beginning that Tesla’s Autopilot tacitly encouraged drivers to take their hands off the wheel even as it ostensibly prohibited them from doing so. The company has since remedied this, at least to some extent. But the tension between Autopilot as a safety feature and Autopilot as a convenience or luxury feature remains.

The road to fully autonomous vehicles was always bound to be bumpy. More people will almost certainly die along the way. But a year after the first U.S. fatality from a semiautonomous driving system, progress continues apace. It appears so far that both the public and the government are prepared to tolerate a few casualties as long as the net safety equation appears to be positive. For Tesla and other self-driving car companies, taking to heart the lessons of crashes like this one will increase the chances that it stays that way.
