ARTICLE TITLE: TikTokâ€™s Content Moderation Allegedly Failed to Adequately Take down Videos Promoting Eating Disorders
TikTok videos that promote anorexia are misspelling common hashtags to beat the 'pro-ana' ban
TikTok said it banned six accounts reported to it for posting content promoting eating habits that are likely to lead to health problems in its latest effort to crackdown on harmful content.
The app is rife with dangerous material including 'pro-ana' or pro-anorexia and 'pro-mia' or pro-bulimia content which has plagued other social media networks such as Tumblr in the past. 
Its algorithm means if users engage with harmful content then TikTok will continue to show them it, and even if they don't engage with it, it may appear on their For You Page regardless.
The app has 800m active users, 41% of whom are aged between 16 and 24, according to Datereportal and Globalwebindex.
