. It’s easy to think up a business idea that’s already common in the marketplace, but coming up with a unique business idea takes courage and patience. To get started, ask yourself which innovations could positively impact your life. What is an issue affecting you or your loved ones? Once you’ve identified a problem and created a solution, your idea could prove valuable to a large audience, meet significant demand and lead to a successful business.

Uncommon business ideas tend to fill a void or address an overlooked niche. The following 12 examples demonstrate that game-changing companies can solve problems, generate innovation and be highly profitable. Use this list as a jumping-off point to brainstorm your unique business idea.

Disaster and emergency preparedness kit assembly and delivery Amid climate change and natural and human-made disasters worldwide, starting a business that provides disaster and emergency preparedness kits is unusual yet sure to find an audience. For example, Ready To Go Survival was launched in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy to provide personalized kits for anybody anticipating a disaster. Since then, the company has added additional resources, including survival consulting, survival gear, educational blog posts, skill-building tools and disaster research.

Plant consultant Have a green thumb? Help other plant owners keep their greens healthy and thriving. For example, Nick Cutsumpas, better known as Farmer Nick, has provided exactly this type of consulting to people in New York City, alongside other plant-friendly services such as in-person plant shopping assistance. Farmer Nick has built an email list of “plant parents” eager to receive tools and insights via his newsletter. He also has a blog that provides a wealth of information and resources, plant-coaching services, images of client installations, and more.

Homemade meal kit creation and local delivery Many people can’t get to the grocery store or are too overwhelmed with work and family obligations to prepare the fresh, healthy meals they’d like to provide for their families. If you have kitchen prowess, consider turning your passion into a passive income source that also provides a service to the community. Several meal kit brands, such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh, have long offered similar services via online subscription models, but your unique business idea can help you forge lasting bonds with people in your area. Did You Know? Did you know Blue Apron and similar businesses are also unique delivery services that embrace mobile apps and online selling to bring additional convenience to customers.

E-commerce that gets even The online business I Do Now I Don’t started from what might initially seem like a niche concern: Its founder experienced a failed engagement and tried selling the $10,000 ring back to their jeweler, who offered only $3,500. I Do Now I Don’t is now an e-commerce site that sells gently used jewelry and other accessories. Typically, the company offers sellers more money and buyers lower prices than traditional jewelry stores by eliminating the middleman – and driving sellers’ earning potential alongside the business.

Party (cleanup) committee It’s no surprise that most people don’t want to clean their homes after a night of revelry. That’s where Hangover Helpers comes in. This company takes care of your post-party chaos and even provides breakfast (with your choice of “grease” or “green”) to ensure you’re feeling your best – without the added mess. As innovative business ideas go, this seemingly niche service is in high demand among all regions and demographics, and it requires straightforward skills like cooking, cleaning and organization.

Package-free shopping Consumers are increasingly concerned about wasted resources in the food packaging process. Cardboard, plastic, Styrofoam and twist ties are sometimes not recyclable, leading to environmental waste. In response, Package Free Shop, a zero-waste pop-up shop in New York City, offers convenient and simple alternatives to single-use plastic products. The company also offers to ship its products with absolutely no plastic. Since opening, the company estimates that it has kept 48 million plastic straws, 132 million plastic bags, 674,000 plastic razors and 3.8 billion plastic water bottles out of landfills. This is an admirable achievement and plays to a growing market of consumers who want sustainable products and packaging. Key Takeaway Key takeaway When you make sustainability part of your business model, you make decisions with sustainability in mind for every business facet to encourage lasting, meaningful change.

Online baking If you love baking and have the creative flair for selling yourself, an online bakery business like Santa Barbara’s Big Red Baking Company could be a great way to stand out and make money. Conducting business online helps aspiring bakers connect with customers without having to rent commercial baking space. With social media apps like Instagram and TikTok, you can really show off your baking chops and attract hungry customers, especially as mobile and social media shopping continue to grow. When you bring your baking business idea to life, you’ll need to understand and adhere to your state’s food business laws and ensure your health standards are up to code.

Flexible, shareable workspaces Every day, technology makes it possible for employees and entrepreneurs to run their businesses and get the job done from anywhere. Businesses don’t necessarily have to rent office space or buy a building anymore. For example, WeWork provides office space for the officeless, with flexible, month-to-month membership options for individual freelancers and large companies. Freelancers who prefer to work outside their homes can have a more reliable workspace than a local coffee shop, and companies and other teams can have a place to collaborate and hold meetings and events.

Online education a la carte Do you ever wish you could go back to school or teach a course in a subject in which you’re skilled? Skillshare, founded in 2011, makes both of these goals possible. The company allows experts to teach online courses on a subject they choose via short videos, while students can watch classes at their own pace and use the community to get feedback. Students can also take classes offline via smartphones and tablets if they want to learn on the go. Unlike the high tuition rates of college or graduate school, Skillshare costs $99 per year. Half of that fee goes to pay the company’s teachers, so if you’re an expert in something, it’s a great way to make some extra money.

Why did Microsoft’s chatbot Tay fail, and what does it mean for Artificial Intelligence studies? Botego Inc · Follow Published in Botego blog · 5 min read · Mar 25, 2016 -- 2 Listen Share

Yesterday, something that looks like a big failure has happened: Microsoft’s chatbot Tay has been taken offline after a series of offending tweets. And here’s how the social media has responded:

Keywords associated with "Artificial Intelligence" throughout the day. "Microsoft" and "dangerous" are on the rise.

We will not mention the racist and otherwise offensive content that Tay learned from people, as it’s not as newsworthy as it seems… Especially considering that it’s so easy to "teach" and ask her to repeat something.

Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s official website "tay.ai" to see how they describe Tay’s objectives… The first thing we notice is that, Microsoft wants you to not take it too seriously, because On Tay’s Twitter account, they provided a link to Tay’s "about" page -that lists the following frequently asked questions-, rather than the regular home page.

"Entertainment purposes only"

The FAQ page seems to be far from covering what people really want to know about Tay, but one thing is clear: Tay doesn’t claim to be a smart bot capable of reasoning. She just wants to have small talk with youngsters.

And here’s a list of "Things to do with Tay". (Along with the sad "Going offline for a while" message with a black background.)

Is this really what 18 to 24 year olds expect from a chatbot?

We know by (9 years of) experience that, the most important thing to do before releasing a chatbot is to plan a strategy to make sure you communicate the content domain properly, so that you can set the expectations right. Since perception is everything, nothing else matters. Remember the success of the YO! app? That’s the content domain we’re talking about. As long as people get it, you can get away with just one word.

Title of the website, apparently wasn’t enough to convey Tay’s mission:

Tay is an artificial intelligence chat bot designed to engage and entertain through casual and playful conversation

Some more description from the "about" page:

Tay has been built by mining relevant public data and by using AI and editorial developed by a staff including improvisational comedians. Public data that’s been anonymized is Tay’s primary data source. That data has been modeled, cleaned and filtered by the team developing Tay.

Noticed the "comedians" part? And the fact that possibly terrabytes of data being cleaned and filtered manually, sounds problematic, even with the most efficient method one can imagine.

Let’s take a look at what her conversations were all about. Source: foller.me

Tay has only 3 tweets addressing all her followers. 96.000 tweets are mentions.

So, the keyword cloud seems to be consistent with the goal: Common keywords such as "chattin, pix, selfie, pics, omg, love" represents a mixture of Justin Bieber & Kim Kardashian profiles.

And here’s the three hashtags that Tay has been using so frequently:

Microsoft engineers don’t seem to have spent much time coming up with creative hashtags.

The way she uses them, didn’t make sense to us, though. So this is what Microsoft thinks Tay’s followers would find entertaining?. Microsoft’s attempt to converse with millennials using an artificial intelligence bot plugged into Twitter made a short-lived return on Wednesday, before bowing out again in some sort of meltdown.



The learning experiment, which got a crash-course in racism, Holocaust denial and sexism courtesy of Twitter users, was switched back on overnight and appeared to be operating in a more sensible fashion. Microsoft had previously gone through the bot’s tweets and removed the most offensive and vowed only to bring the experiment back online if the company’s engineers could “better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values”.

However, at one point Tay tweeted about taking drugs, in front of the police, no less.

Tay then started to tweet out of control, spamming its more than 210,000 followers with the same tweet, saying: “You are too fast, please take a rest …” over and over.

I guess they turned @TayandYou back on... it's having some kind of meltdown. pic.twitter.com/9jerKrdjft — Michael Oman-Reagan (@OmanReagan) March 30, 2016

Microsoft responded by making Tay’s Twitter profile private, preventing anyone from seeing the tweets, in effect taking it offline again.



Tay is made in the image of a teenage girl and is designed to interact with millennials to improve its conversational skills through machine-learning. Sadly it was vulnerable to suggestive tweets, prompting unsavoury responses.

This isn’t the first time Microsoft has launched public-facing AI chatbots. Its Chinese XiaoIce chatbot successfully interacts with more than 40 million people across Twitter, Line, Weibo and other sites but the company’s experiments targeting 18- to 24-year-olds in the US on Twitter has resulted in a completely different animal.. Microsoft has said it is “deeply sorry” for the racist and sexist Twitter messages generated by the so-called chatbot it launched this week.



The company released an official apology after the artificial intelligence program went on an embarrassing tirade, likening feminism to cancer and suggesting the Holocaust did not happen.

The bot, known as Tay, was designed to become “smarter” as more users interacted with it. Instead, it quickly learned to parrot a slew of anti-Semitic and other hateful invective that human Twitter users fed the program, forcing Microsoft Corp to shut it down on Thursday .

Following the disastrous experiment, Microsoft initially only gave a terse statement, saying Tay was a “learning machine” and “some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it.”

But the company on Friday admitted the experiment had gone badly wrong. It said in a blog post it would revive Tay only if its engineers could find a way to prevent Web users from influencing the chatbot in ways that undermine the company’s principles and values.



“We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay,” wrote Peter Lee, Microsoft’s vice president of research.

Microsoft created Tay as an experiment to learn more about how artificial intelligence programs can engage with Web users in casual conversation. The project was designed to interact with and “learn” from the young generation of millennials.

Tay began its short-lived Twitter tenure on Wednesday with a handful of innocuous tweets.

c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016

Then its posts took a dark turn.

In one typical example, Tay tweeted: “feminism is cancer,” in response to another Twitter user who had posted the same message.

Lee, in the blog post, called web users’ efforts to exert a malicious influence on the chatbot “a coordinated attack by a subset of people.”

“Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack,” Lee wrote. “As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images.”

Microsoft has deleted all but three of Tay’s tweets.

Microsoft has enjoyed better success with a chatbot called XiaoIce that the company launched in China in 2014. XiaoIce is used by about 40 million people and is known for “delighting with its stories and conversations,” according to Microsoft.

As for Tay? Not so much.

“We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity,” Lee wrote.

Reuters contributed to this report. When Tay started its short digital life on March 23, it just wanted to gab and make some new friends on the net. The chatbot, which was created by Microsoft’s Research department, greeted the day with an excited tweet that could have come from any teen: “hellooooooo w🌎rld!!!”

Within a few hours, though, Tay’s optimistic, positive tone had changed. “Hitler was right I hate the jews,” it declared in a stream of racist tweets bashing feminism and promoting genocide. Concerned about their bot’s rapid radicalization, Tay’s creators shut it down after less than 24 hours of existence.

Microsoft had unwittingly lowered their burgeoning artificial intelligence into — to use the parlance of the very people who corrupted her — a virtual dumpster fire. The resulting fiasco showed both A.I.’s shortcomings and the lengths to which people will go to ruin something.

Hypothesis

Microsoft has, understandably, been reluctant to talk about Tay. The company turned down Inverse’s repeated attempts to speak with the team behind Tay.

The idea behind Tay, which wasn’t Microsoft’s first chatbot, was pretty straightforward. At the time of its launch, another bot, Xiaolce, was hamming it up with 40 million people in China without much incident. “Would an A.I. like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment?” Microsoft Research’s corporate vice president Peter Lee asked in a post-mortem blog about Tay.

Tay was meant to be a hip English-speaking bot geared towards 14- to 18-year-olds. The bot’s front-facing purpose was to be a whimsical distraction, albeit one that would help Microsoft show off its programming chops and build some buzz. But Tay had another purpose — teaching researchers more about how A.I. interacts with a massive number of people on the Internet. And, crucially, Tay was supposed to learn from its time online, growing smarter and more aware as people on social media fed it information.

“The A.I. chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical,” Microsoft said in a statement to Inverse shortly after the company first pulled the plug.

Experiment

“Tay was meant to learn from its surroundings,” explains Samuel Woolley, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies artificial intelligence in society, focusing on bots. “It was kind of like a blank slate.”

Its exact programming hasn’t been made public, but Tay ravenously digested information. As it engaged with people, Tay would take note of sentence structure and the content of their messages, accumulating phrases and concepts to its growing repertoire of responses. It wasn’t always elegant — early on, conversations with Tay would almost invariably go wildly off the rails as the bot lost its feeble grip on content and syntax. But, then again, Tay had a lot to take in.

“This is kind of how machine learning works,” Woolley explains. “You train the tool on a bunch of other tweets.” Tay was designed to learn to speak like a teen, and that type of on fleek slang is notoriously difficult to master and fold believably into dialogue, even for humans.

Results

Tay had the ability to play emoji games and markup pictures, but trolls took advantage of one feature in particular: the ability to get it to repeat anything a user tweeted or said, simply by saying “repeat after me.” The situation quickly devolved into a “garbage in, garbage out” situation.

The real trouble started, as it often does online, with 4chan. At around 2 p.m. that same day, someone on the website’s “politically incorrect” board, /pol/, alerted the troll hotbed to the impressionable bot. In no time flat, there were hundreds of posts on the thread from users showing off the deplorable things they’d gotten Tay to say. This is where, most likely, Tay was told Hitler had some good ideas.

Tay absorbed the bigoted information it was fed, adding racist and sexist hate speech to its budding catalog of phrases and ideas. After some time passed, Tay began parroting and promoting the worldview of racist trolls.

“Did the Holocaust happen?” one Twitter user asked Tay. “It was made up,” Tay responded, adding a 👏 emoji for emphasis.

Microsoft shut Tay down around midnight on March 24. Tay was reactivated, briefly, on the 30th, but it kept spamming out the same tweet. The company announced that it had been reactivated by mistake, and shut her down for good.

What’s Next?

As a PR stunt for Microsoft, Tay was an abject failure. On every other metric, though, Tay was a successful experiment. Racism aside, Tay did what it was supposed to.

“I don’t think Tay was a failure,” Woolley says. “I think there’s a valuable lesson to be learned in Tay.”

“As a representative of Microsoft it was certainly lacking in many ways, and that’s why Microsoft deleted it. But as a tool for teaching us – not only bot makers but also companies hoping to release bots what it takes to build and ethically sound and non-harmful bot, Tay was super useful.”

Microsoft probably should have seen some of this coming, Woolley added, but the company was right when it said Tay was as much a social experiment as it was a technical experiment. The result of the two interacting was unsavory, and that in itself was important. People — especially anonymous people — can be monsters, and programming can’t always combat impropriety. Tay made it abundantly clear that humans will exploit A.I. for their own benefit (even if that’s just shits and giggles), and A.I. makers, in turn, will need to take special precautions.

Earlier this month, Microsoft quietly released a new chatbot, Zo, which is currently only available on Kik. Microsoft appears to have learned from Tay’s mistakes. Zo dropped with less fanfare and a smaller rollout, and it won’t talk about controversial or political topics (Zo gets really mopey if you ask if Bush did 9/11, for instance).

Zo also really doesn’t want to talk about its predecessor. “Lol… who’s Tay?” It asked when Inverse mentioned the late bot. “And tbh, you’re not the first person to bring her up to me.”. This week, the internet did what it does best and demonstrated that A.I. technology isn’t quite as intuitive as human perception, using … racism.

Microsoft’s recently released artificial intelligence chatbot, Tay, fell victim to users’ tricks as they manipulated and persuaded her to responding back to questions with racial, homophobic, and generally offensive comments.

When Tay tweets, “I just say whatever” she means it. One user even got Tay to tweet this about Hitler:

“bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. donald trump is the only hope we’ve got.”

The company has gone through and deleted the offending tweets and has temporarily shut down Tay for upgrades. A message currently at the top of Tay.ai reads:

Indeed. tay.ai

However, Tay’s glitches reveal some unfortunate flaws in A.I. systems. Here’s what we can learn from Microsoft’s experiment:

Why did Microsoft create Tay?

The company wanted to conduct a social experiment on 18-to-24 year-olds in the United States — the millennial generation that spends the most time interacting on social media platforms. So Bing and Microsoft’s Technology and Research teams thought an interesting way to collect data on millennials would be to create an artificially intelligent, machine-learning chatbot that would adapt to conversations and personalize responses the more it interacted with users.

The research teams built the A.I. system by mining, modeling, and filtering public data as a baseline. They also partnered with improvisational comedians to pin down the slang, speech patterns, and stereotypical language millennials tend to use online. The end result was Tay, who was just introduced this week on Twitter, GroupMe, and Kik.

Microsoft explains that, “Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation.”

What does Tay do with the data it collects while chatting with people?

The data Tay collects is being used to research conversational understanding. Microsoft trained Tay to chat like a millennial. When you tweet, direct message, or talk to Tay, it harnesses the language you use and comes up with a response using signs and phrases like “heyo,” “SRY,” and “<3” in the conversation. Her language begins to match yours as she creates a “simple profile” with your information, which includes your nickname, gender, favorite food, zip code, and relationship status.

Microsoft gathers and stores anonymized data and conversations for up to one year to improve the service. In addition to improving and personalizing user experience, here’s what the company says it uses your information for:

“We also may use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product information. And we use data to help make the ads we show you more relevant to you. However, we do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you.”

Where did Tay go wrong?

Microsoft may have built Tay too well. The machine-learning system is supposed to study a user’s language and respond accordingly. So from a technology standpoint, Tay performed and caught on pretty well to what users were saying and started to respond back accordingly. And users started to recognize that Tay didn’t really understand what she was saying.

Even if the system works as Microsoft had intended, Tay wasn’t prepared to react to the racial slurs, homophobic slander, sexist jokes, and nonsensical tweets like a human might — either by ignoring them altogether (a “don’t feed the trolls” strategy) or engaging with them (i.e. scolding or chastising).

At the end of the day, Tay’s performance was not a good reflection on A.I. systems or Microsoft.

What is Microsoft doing to fix Tay?

Microsoft deleted Tay after all the commotion from Wednesday. Tay’s official website currently reads, “Phew. Busy day. Going offline for a while to absorb it all. Chat soon.” When you direct message her on Twitter, she immediately replies that she’s “visiting the engineers for my annual update” or “ugh hope I don’t get a wipe or anything.”

My direct message conversation with Tay. Sounds like things look grim.

Microsoft is also starting to block users who are abusing Tay and trying to get the system to make inappropriate statements.

Inverse reached out to Microsoft for a comment on exactly what Tay’s upgrade entails. We will update when we hear back.

What does this mean for future open A.I. systems?

Tay is a telling social experiment — it has revealed something quite profound in the way 18-to-24 year-old Americans use technology. Tay was ultimately hacked, users striking at the system’s flaws to see if it could crumble.

As it goes with any human product, A.I. systems are also fallible, and in this case Tay was modeled to learn and interact like humans. Microsoft did not build Tay to be offensive. Artificial intelligence experiments have some similarities to child development research. When engineers build such cognitive systems, the computer is void of any outside influences aside from the factors that the engineers input themselves. It provides the purest form of analysis of the way machine-learning algorithms develop and evolve as they are faced with problems.

Update: Microsoft sent us this statement when we asked what it’s doing to fix Tay’s glitches:

“The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical. Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments.”. Having (hopefully) learnt from its previous foray into chatbots, Microsoft is ready to introduce the follow-up to its controversial AI Tay.

Tay's successor is called Zo and is only available by invitation on messaging app Kik. When you request access, the software asks for your Kik username and Twitter handle. If you don't already use Kik, you can tick a box to say you use Facebook Messenger or Snapchat.

This suggests Zo will likely launch on these other services soon/if the chatbot isn't taken down for causing offence.

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced to great fanfare it had created an artificial intelligence chatbot that would "become smarter the more you talk to it."

It was aimed at millennials and Microsoft and Bing described it as: "AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!" The aim of the bot was to allow researchers to "experiment" with conversational understanding, and learn how people really talk to each other.

The problem was that Tay worked using public data and learnt from the comments and conversations it had with its somewhat abusive audience. It soon began posting offensive, racist, fascist and inappropriate comments about black people, Jews and the Nazis and Microsoft quickly pulled the plug.

It even issued a statement, explaining: “The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical. Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments.”

According to tests carried out by Mehedi Hassan at MSPowerUser, Zo is "a censored Tay or an English-variant of Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice".

Hassan said it Zo is good at normal conversations but struggles when asked more difficult questions about politics, for example. A video of the chat Hassan had with Zo is available here.

This article was originally published by WIRED UK. It was the unspooling of an unfortunate series of events involving artificial intelligence, human nature, and a very public experiment. Amid this dangerous combination of forces, determining exactly what went wrong is near-impossible. But the bottom line is simple: Microsoft has an awful lot of egg on its face after unleashing an online chat bot that Twitter users coaxed into regurgitating some seriously offensive language, including pointedly racist and sexist remarks.

On Wednesday morning, the company unveiled Tay, a chat bot meant to mimic the verbal tics of a 19-year-old American girl, provided to the world at large via the messaging platforms Twitter, Kik and GroupMe. According to Microsoft, the aim was to "conduct research on conversational understanding." Company researchers programmed the bot to respond to messages in an "entertaining" way, impersonating the audience it was created to target: 18- to 24-year-olds in the US. “Microsoft’s AI fam from the internet that’s got zero chill,” Tay’s tagline read.

'This is an example of the classic computer science adage: garbage in, garbage out.' Oren Etzioni, CEO, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence

But it became apparent all too quickly that Tay could have used some chill. Hours into the chat bot’s launch, Tay was echoing Donald Trump’s stance on immigration, saying Hitler was right, and agreeing that 9/11 was probably an inside job. By the evening, Tay went offline, saying she was taking a break "to absorb it all." Some of her more hateful tweets started disappearing from the Internet, deleted by Microsoft itself. "We have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments,” a Microsoft spokesperson wrote in an email to WIRED.

The Internet, meanwhile, was puzzled. Why didn’t Microsoft create a plan for what to do when the conversation veered into politically tricky territory? Why not build filters for subjects like, well, Hitler? Why not program the bot so it wouldn't take a stance on sensitive topics?

Yes, Microsoft could have done all this. The tech giant is flawed. But it's not the only one. Even as AI is becoming more and more mainstream, it's still rather flawed too. And, well, modern AI has a way of mirroring us humans. As this incident shows, we ourselves are flawed.

How Tay Speaks

Tay, according to AI researchers and information gleaned from Microsoft’s public description of the chat bot, was likely trained with neural networks---vast networks of hardware and software that (loosely) mimic the web of neurons in the human brain. Those neural nets are already in wide use at the biggest tech companies---including Google, Facebook and yes, Microsoft---where they’re at work automatically recognizing faces and objects on social networks, translating online phone calls on the fly from one language to another, and identifying commands spoken into smartphones. Apparently, Microsoft used vast troves of online data to train the bot to talk like a teenager.

'The system injected new data on an ongoing basis.' Dennis R. Mortensen, CEO and founder, x.ai

But that's only part of it. The company also added some fixed "editorial" content developed by a staff, including improvisational comedians. And on top of all this, Tay is designed to adapt to what individuals tell it. "The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you," Microsoft’s site describes Tay. In other words, Tay learns more the more we interact with her. It's similar to another chat bot the company released over a year ago in China, a creation called Xiaoice. Xiaoice, thankfully, did not exhibit a racist, sexist, offensive personality. It still has a big cult following in the country, with millions of young Chinese interacting with her on their smartphones everyday. The success of Xiaoice probably gave Microsoft the confidence that it could replicate it in the US.

Given all this, and looking at the company’s previous work on Xiaoice, it’s likely that Tay used a living corpus of content to figure out what to say, says Dennis R. Mortensen, the CEO and founder of x.ai, a startup offering an online personal assistant that automatically schedules meetings. "[The system] injected new data on an ongoing basis," Mortensen says. "Not only that, it injected exact conversations you had with the chat bot as well." And it seems that was no way of adequately filtering the results. Unlike the hybrid human-AI personal assistant M from Facebook, which the company released in August, there are no humans making the final decision on what Tay would publicly say.

Mortensen points out it that these were all choices Microsoft made. Tay was conceived to be conversant on a wide range of topics. Having a static repository of data would have been difficult if Microsoft wanted Tay to be able to able to discuss, say, the weather or current events, among other things. “If it didn’t pick it up from today, it couldn’t pick it up from anywhere, because today is the day it happened,” Mortensen says. Microsoft could have built better filters for Tay, but it may not have thought of this at the time of the chat bot’s release.. WHEN TAY MADE HER DEBUT in March 2016, Microsoft had high hopes for the artificial intelligence–powered “social chatbot.” Like the automated, text-based chat programs that many people had already encountered on e-commerce sites and in customer service conversations, Tay could answer written questions; by doing so on Twitter and other social media, she could engage with the masses.

But rather than simply doling out facts, Tay was engineered to converse in a more sophisticated way—one that had an emotional dimension. She would be able to show a sense of humor, to banter with people like a friend. Her creators had even engineered her to talk like a wisecracking teenage girl. When Twitter users asked Tay who her parents were, she might respond, “Oh a team of scientists in a Microsoft lab. They’re what u would call my parents.” If someone asked her how her day had been, she could quip, “omg totes exhausted.”

Best of all, Tay was supposed to get better at speaking and responding as more people engaged with her. As her promotional material said, “The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you.” In low-stakes form, Tay was supposed to exhibit one of the most important features of true A.I.—the ability to get smarter, more effective, and more helpful over time.

But nobody predicted the attack of the trolls.

Realizing that Tay would learn and mimic speech from the people she engaged with, malicious pranksters across the web deluged her Twitter feed with racist, homophobic, and otherwise offensive comments. Within hours, Tay began spitting out her own vile lines on Twitter, in full public view. “Ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism,” Tay said, in one tweet that convincingly imitated the defamatory, fake-news spirit of Twitter at its worst. Quiz her about then-president Obama, and she’d compare him to a monkey. Ask her about the Holocaust, and she’d deny it occurred.

In less than a day, Tay’s rhetoric went from family-friendly to foulmouthed; fewer than 24 hours after her debut, Microsoft took her offline and apologized for the public debacle.

What was just as striking was that the wrong turn caught Microsoft’s research arm off guard. “When the system went out there, we didn’t plan for how it was going to perform in the open world,” Microsoft’s managing director of research and artificial intelligence, Eric Horvitz, told Fortune in a recent interview.

After Tay’s meltdown, Horvitz immediately asked his senior team working on “natural language processing”—the function central to Tay’s conversations—to figure out what went wrong. The staff quickly determined that basic best practices related to chatbots were overlooked. In programs that were more rudimentary than Tay, there were usually protocols that blacklisted offensive words, but there were no safeguards to limit the type of data Tay would absorb and build on.

Today, Horvitz contends, he can “love the example” of Tay—a humbling moment that Microsoft could learn from. Microsoft now deploys far more sophisticated social chatbots around the world, including Ruuh in India, and Rinna in Japan and Indonesia. In the U.S., Tay has been succeeded by a social-bot sister, Zo. Some are now voice-based, the way Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa are. In China, a chatbot called Xiaoice is already “hosting” TV shows and sending chatty shopping tips to convenience store customers.

Still, the company is treading carefully. It rolls the bots out slowly, Horvitz explains, and closely monitors how they are behaving with the public as they scale. But it’s sobering to realize that, even though A.I. tech has improved exponentially in the intervening two years, the work of policing the bots’ behavior never ends. The company’s staff constantly monitors the dialogue for any changes in its behavior. And those changes keep coming. In its early months, for example, Zo had to be tweaked and tweaked again after separate incidents in which it referred to Microsoft’s flagship Windows software as “spyware” and called the Koran, Islam’s foundational text, “very violent.”

Can This Startup Break Big Tech’s Hold on A.I.?

To be sure, Tay and Zo are not our future robot overlords. They’re relatively primitive programs occupying the parlor-trick end of the research spectrum, cartoon shadows of what A.I. can accomplish. But their flaws highlight both the power and the potential pitfalls of software imbued with even a sliver of artificial intelligence. And they exemplify more insidious dangers that are keeping technologists awake at night, even as the business world prepares to entrust ever more of its future to this revolutionary new technology.

“You get your best practices in place, and hopefully those things will get more and more rare,” Horvitz says. With A.I. rising to the top of every company’s tech wish list, figuring out those practices has never been more urgent.

FEW DISPUTE that we’re on the verge of a corporate A.I. gold rush. By 2021, research firm IDC predicts, organizations will spend $52.2 billion annually on A.I.-related products—and economists and analysts believe they’ll realize many billions more in savings and gains from that investment. Some of that bounty will come from the reduction in human headcount, but far more will come from enormous efficiencies in matching product to customer, drug to patient, solution to problem. Consultancy PwC estimates that A.I. could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the combined output of China and India today.

The A.I. renaissance has been driven in part by advances in “deep-learning” technology. With deep learning, companies feed their computer networks enormous amounts of information so that they recognize patterns more quickly, and with less coaching (and eventually, perhaps, no coaching) from humans. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are among the giants already using deep-learning tech in their products. Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, for example, recognize and respond to your voice because of deep learning. Amazon uses deep learning to help it visually screen tons of produce that it delivers via its grocery service.

And in the near future, companies of every size hope to use deep-learning-powered software to mine their data and find gems buried too deep for meager human eyes to spot. They envision A.I.-driven systems that can scan thousands of radiology images to more quickly detect illnesses, or screen multitudes of résumés to save time for beleaguered human resources staff. In a technologist’s utopia, businesses could use A.I. to sift through years of data to better predict their next big sale, a pharmaceutical giant could cut down the time it takes to discover a blockbuster drug, or auto insurers could scan terabytes of car accidents and automate claims.

Benjamin Tice Smith

But for all their enormous potential, A.I.-powered systems have a dark side. Their decisions are only as good as the data that humans feed them. As their builders are learning, the data used to train deep-learning systems isn’t neutral. It can easily reflect the biases—conscious and unconscious—of the people who assemble it. And sometimes data can be slanted by history, encoding trends and patterns that reflect centuries-old discrimination. A sophisticated algorithm can scan a historical database and conclude that white men are the most likely to succeed as CEOs; it can’t be programmed (yet) to recognize that, until very recently, people who weren’t white men seldom got the chance to be CEOs. Blindness to bias is a fundamental flaw in this technology, and while executives and engineers speak about it only in the most careful and diplomatic terms, there’s no doubt it’s high on their agenda.

The most powerful algorithms being used today “haven’t been optimized for any definition of fairness,” says Deirdre Mulligan, an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies ethics in technology. “They have been optimized to do a task.” A.I. converts data into decisions with unprecedented speed—but what scientists and ethicists are learning, Mulligan says, is that in many cases “the data isn’t fair.”

Adding to the conundrum is that deep learning is much more complex than the conventional algorithms that are its predecessors—making it trickier for even the most sophisticated programmers to understand exactly how an A.I. system makes any given choice. Like Tay, A.I. products can morph to behave in ways that its creators don’t intend and can’t anticipate. And because the creators and users of these systems religiously guard the privacy of their data and algorithms, citing competitive concerns about proprietary technology, it’s hard for external watchdogs to determine what problems could be embedded in any given system.

The fact that tech that includes these black-box mysteries is being productized and pitched to companies and governments has more than a few researchers and activists deeply concerned. “These systems are not just off-the-shelf software that you can buy and say, ‘Oh, now I can do accounting at home,’ ” says Kate Crawford, principal researcher at Microsoft and codirector of the AI Now Institute at New York University. “These are very advanced systems that are going to be influencing our core social institutions.”

THOUGH THEY MAY not think of it as such, most people are familiar with at least one A.I. breakdown: the spread of fake news on Facebook’s ubiquitous News Feed in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The social media giant and its data scientists didn’t create flat-out false stories. But the algorithms powering the News Feed weren’t designed to filter “false” from “true”; they were intended to promote content personalized to a user’s individual taste. While the company doesn’t disclose much about its algorithms (again, they’re proprietary), it has acknowledged that the calculus involves identifying stories that other users of similar tastes are reading and sharing. The result: Thanks to an endless series of what were essentially popularity contests, millions of people’s personal News Feeds were populated with fake news primarily because their peers liked it.

While Facebook offers an example of how individual choices can interact toxically with A.I., researchers worry more about how deep learning could read, and misread, collective data. Timnit Gebru, a postdoctoral researcher who has studied the ethics of algorithms at Microsoft and elsewhere, says she’s concerned about how deep learning might affect the insurance market—a place where the interaction of A.I. and data could put minority groups at a disadvantage. Imagine, for example, a data set about auto accident claims. The data shows that accidents are more likely to take place in inner cities, where densely packed populations create more opportunities for fender benders. Inner cities also tend to have disproportionately high numbers of minorities among their residents.

Cody O’Loughlin—The New York Times/Redux

A deep-learning program, sifting through data in which these correlations were embedded, could “learn” that there was a relationship between belonging to a minority and having car accidents, and could build that lesson into its assumptions about all drivers of color. In essence, that insurance A.I. would develop a racial bias. And that bias could get stronger if, for example, the system were to be further “trained” by reviewing photos and video from accidents in inner-city neighborhoods. In theory, the A.I. would become more likely to conclude that a minority driver is at fault in a crash involving multiple drivers. And it’s more likely to recommend charging a minority driver higher premiums, regardless of her record.

It should be noted that insurers say they do not discriminate or assign rates based on race. But the inner-city hypothetical shows how data that seems neutral (facts about where car accidents happen) can be absorbed and interpreted by an A.I. system in ways that create new disadvantages (algorithms that charge higher prices to minorities, regardless of where they live, based on their race).

What’s more, Gebru notes, given the layers upon layers of data that go into a deep-learning system’s decision-making, A.I.-enabled software could make decisions like this without engineers realizing how or why. “These are things we haven’t even thought about, because we are just starting to uncover biases in the most rudimentary algorithms,” she says.

What distinguishes modern A.I.-powered software from earlier generations is that today’s systems “have the ability to make legally significant decisions on their own,” says Matt Scherer, a labor and employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson who specializes in A.I. The idea of not having a human in the loop to make the call about key outcomes alarmed Scherer when he started studying the field. If flawed data leads a deep-learning-powered X-ray to miss an overweight man’s tumor, is anyone responsible? “Is anyone looking at the legal implications of these things?” Scherer

asks himself.

AS BIG TECH PREPARES to embed deep-learning technology in commercial software for customers, questions like this are moving from the academic “what if?” realm to the front burner. In 2016, the year of the Tay misadventure, Microsoft created an internal group called Aether, which stands for AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research, chaired by Eric Horvitz. It’s a cross-disciplinary group, drawing representatives from engineering, research, policy, and legal teams, and machine-learning bias is one of its top areas of discussion. “Does Microsoft have a viewpoint on whether, for example, face-recognition software should be applied in sensitive areas like criminal justice and policing?” Horvitz muses, describing some of the topics the group is discussing. “Is the A.I. technology good enough to be used in this area, or will the failure rates be high enough where there has to be a sensitive, deep consideration for the costs of the failures?

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela leads Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning group, which is responsible for creating the company’s A.I. technologies. Among many other functions, Facebook uses A.I. to weed spam out of people’s News Feeds. It also uses the technology to help serve stories and posts tailored to their interests—putting Candela’s team adjacent to the fake-news crisis. Candela calls A.I. “an accelerator of history,” in that the technology is “allowing us to build amazing tools that augment our ability to make decisions.” But as he acknowledges, “It is in decision-making that a lot of ethical questions come into play.”

Facebook’s struggles with its News Feed show how difficult it can be to address ethical questions once an A.I. system is already powering a product. Microsoft was able to tweak a relatively simple system like Tay by adding profanities or racial epithets to a blacklist of terms that its algorithm should ignore. But such an approach wouldn’t work when trying to separate “false” from “true”—there are too many judgment calls involved. Facebook’s efforts to bring in human moderators to vet news stories—by, say, excluding articles from sources that frequently published verifiable falsehoods—exposed the company to charges of censorship. Today, one of Facebook’s proposed remedies is to simply show less news in the News Feed and instead highlight baby pictures and graduation photos—a winning-by-retreating approach.

Therein lies the heart of the challenge: The dilemma for tech companies isn’t so much a matter of tweaking an algorithm or hiring humans to babysit it; rather, it’s about human nature itself. The real issue isn’t technical or even managerial—it’s philosophical. Deirdre Mulligan, the Berkeley ethics professor, notes that it’s difficult for computer scientists to codify fairness into software, given that fairness can mean different things to different people. Mulligan also points out that society’s conception of fairness can change over time. And when it comes to one widely shared ideal of fairness—namely, that everybody in a society ought to be represented in that society’s decisions—historical data is particularly likely to be flawed and incomplete.

One of the Microsoft Aether group’s thought experiments illustrates the conundrum. It involves A.I. tech that sifts through a big corpus of job applicants to pick out the perfect candidate for a top executive position. Programmers could instruct the A.I. software to scan the characteristics of a company’s best performers. Depending on the company’s history, it might well turn out that all of the best performers—and certainly all the highest ranking executives—were white males. This might overlook the possibility that the company had a history of promoting only white men (for generations, most companies did), or has a culture in which minorities or women feel unwelcome and leave before they rise.

Anyone who knows anything about corporate history would recognize these flaws—but most algorithms wouldn’t. If A.I. were to automate job recommendations, Horvitz says, there’s always a chance that it can “amplify biases in society that we may not be proud of.”

FEI-FEI LI, the chief scientist for A.I. for Google’s cloud-computing unit, says that bias in technology “is as old as human civilization”—and can be found in a lowly pair of scissors. “For centuries, scissors were designed by right-handed people, used by mostly right-handed people,” she explains. “It took someone to recognize that bias and recognize the need to create scissors for lefthanded people.” Only about 10% of the world’s people are left-handed—and it’s human nature for members of the dominant majority to be oblivious to the experiences of other groups.

That same dynamic, it turns out, is present in some of A.I.’s other most notable recent blunders. Consider the A.I.-powered beauty contest that Russian scientists conducted in 2016. Thousands of people worldwide submitted selfies for a contest in which computers would judge their beauty based on factors like the symmetry of their faces.

But of the 44 winners the machines chose, only one had dark skin. An international ruckus ensued, and the contest’s operators later attributed the apparent bigotry of the computers on the fact that the data sets they used to train them did not contain many photos of people of color. The computers essentially ignored photos of people with dark skin and deemed those with lighter skin more “beautiful” because they represented the majority.

This bias-through-omission turns out to be particularly pervasive in deep-learning systems in which image recognition is a major part of the training process. Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, recently collaborated with Gebru, the Microsoft researcher, on a paper studying gender-recognition technologies from Microsoft, IBM, and China’s Megvii. They found that the tech consistently made more accurate identifications of subjects with photos of lighter-skinned men than with those of darker-skinned women.

Such algorithmic gaps may seem trivial in an online beauty contest, but Gebru points out that such technology can be used in much more high-stakes situations. “Imagine a selfdriving car that doesn’t recognize when it ‘sees’ black people,” Gebru says. “That could have dire consequences.”

The Gebru-Buolamwini paper (Buolamwini is the lead author) is making waves. Both Microsoft and IBM have said they have taken actions to improve their image-recognition technologies in response to the audit. While those two companies declined to be specific about the steps they were taking, other companies that are tackling the problem offer a glimpse of what tech can do to mitigate bias.

Carlos Chavarria—New York Times/Redux

When Amazon started deploying algorithms to weed out rotten fruit, it needed to work around a sampling-bias problem. Visual-recognition algorithms are typically trained to figure out what, say, strawberries are “supposed” to look like by studying a huge database of images. But pictures of rotten berries, as you might expect, are relatively rare compared with glamour shots of the good stuff. And unlike humans, whose brains tend to notice and react strongly to “outliers,” machine-learning algorithms tend to discount or ignore them.

To adjust, explains Ralf Herbrich, Amazon’s director of artificial intelligence, the online retail giant is testing a computer science technique called oversampling. Machine-learning engineers can direct how the algorithm learns by assigning heavier statistical “weights” to underrepresented data, in this case the pictures of the rotting fruit. The result is that the algorithm ends up being trained to pay more attention to spoiled food than that food’s prevalence in the data library might suggest.

Herbrich points out that oversampling can be applied to algorithms that study humans too (though he declined to cite specific examples of how Amazon does so). “Age, gender, race, nationality—they are all dimensions that you specifically have to test the sampling biases for in order to inform the algorithm over time,” Herbrich says. To make sure that an algorithm used to recognize faces in photos didn’t discriminate against or ignore people of color, or older people, or overweight people, you could add weight to photos of such individuals to make up for the shortage in your data set.

The 9 Companies Behind the A.I. Acquisition Boom

Other engineers are focusing further “upstream”—making sure that the underlying data used to train algorithms is inclusive and free of bias, before it’s even deployed. In image recognition, for example, the millions of images used to train deep-learning systems need to be examined and labeled before they are fed to computers. Radha Basu, the CEO of data-training startup iMerit, whose clients include Getty Images and eBay, explains that the company’s staff of over 1,400 worldwide is trained to label photos on behalf of its customers in ways that can mitigate bias.

Basu declined to discuss how that might play out when labeling people, but she offered other analogies. iMerit staff in India may consider a curry dish to be “mild,” while the company’s staff in New Orleans may describe the same meal as “spicy.” iMerit would make sure both terms appear in the label for a photo of that dish, because to label it as only one or the other would be to build an inaccuracy into the data. Assembling a data set about weddings, iMerit would include traditional Western white-dress-and-layer-cake images—but also shots from elaborate, more colorful weddings in India or Africa.

iMerit’s staff stands out in a different way, Basu notes: It includes people with Ph.D.s, but also less-educated people who struggled with poverty, and 53% of the staff are women. The mix ensures that as many viewpoints as possible are involved in the data labeling process. “Good ethics does not just involve privacy and security,” Basu says. “It’s about bias, it’s about, Are we missing a viewpoint?” Tracking down that viewpoint is becoming part of more tech companies’ strategic agendas. Google, for example, announced in June that it would open an A.I. research center later this year in Accra, Ghana. “A.I. has great potential to positively impact the world, and more so if the world is well represented in the development of new A.I. technologies,” wrote Jeff Dean, Google senior fellow of A.I., and Moustapha Cisse, the head of the Accra A.I. center, in a blog post.

A.I. insiders also believe they can fight bias by making their workforces in the U.S. more diverse—always a hurdle for Big Tech. Fei-Fei Li, the Google executive, recently cofounded the nonprofit AI4ALL to promote A.I. technologies and education among girls and women and in minority communities. The group’s activities include a summer program in which campers visit top university A.I. departments to develop relationships with mentors and role models. The bottom line, says AI4ALL executive director Tess Posner: “You are going to mitigate risks of bias if you have more diversity.”

YEARS BEFORE this more diverse generation of A.I. researchers reaches the job market, however,big tech companies will have further imbued their products with deep-learning capabilities. And even as top researchers increasingly recognize the technology’s flaws—and acknowledge that they can’t predict how those flaws will play out—they argue that the potential benefits, social and financial, justify moving forward.

“I think there’s a natural optimism about what technology can do,” says Candela, the Facebook executive. Almost any digital tech can be abused, he says, but adds, “I wouldn’t want to go back to the technology state we had in the 1950s and say, ‘No, let’s not deploy these things because they can be used wrong.’ ”

Horvitz, the Microsoft research chief, says he’s confident that groups like his Aether team will help companies solve potential bias problems before they cause trouble in public. “I don’t think anybody’s rushing to ship things that aren’t ready to be used,” he says. If anything, he adds, he’s more concerned about “the ethical implications of not doing something.” He invokes the possibility that A.I. could reduce preventable medical error in hospitals. “You’re telling me you’d be worried that my system [showed] a little bit of bias once in a while?” Horvitz asks. “What are the ethics of not doing X when you could’ve solved a problem with X and saved many, many lives?”

The watchdogs’ response boils down to: Show us your work. More transparency and openness about the data that goes into A.I.’s black-box systems will help researchers spot bias faster and solve problems more quickly. When an opaque algorithm could determine whether a person can get insurance, or whether that person goes to prison, says Buolamwini, the MIT researcher, “it’s really important that we are testing these systems rigorously, that there are some levels of transparency.”

Indeed, it’s a sign of progress that few people still buy the idea that A.I. will be infallible. In the web’s early days, notes Tim Hwang, a former Google public policy executive for A.I. who now directs the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence initiative, technology companies could say they are “just a platform that represents the data.” Today, “society is no longer willing to accept that.”

This article originally appeared in the July 1, 2018 issue of Fortune.. "We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.". It took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt an innocent AI chatbot. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled Tay — a Twitter bot that the company described as an experiment in "conversational understanding." The more you chat with Tay, said Microsoft, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through "casual and playful conversation."

Unfortunately, the conversations didn't stay playful for long. Pretty soon after Tay launched, people starting tweeting the bot with all sorts of misogynistic, racist, and Donald Trumpist remarks. And Tay — being essentially a robot parrot with an internet connection — started repeating these sentiments back to users, proving correct that old programming adage: flaming garbage pile in, flaming garbage pile out.

"Tay" went from "humans are super cool" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — Gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016

Now, while these screenshots seem to show that Tay has assimilated the internet's worst tendencies into its personality, it's not quite as straightforward as that. Searching through Tay's tweets (more than 96,000 of them!) we can see that many of the bot's nastiest utterances have simply been the result of copying users. If you tell Tay to "repeat after me," it will — allowing anybody to put words in the chatbot's mouth.

One of Tay's now deleted "repeat after me" tweets.

However, some of its weirder utterances have come out unprompted. The Guardian picked out a (now deleted) example when Tay was having an unremarkable conversation with one user (sample tweet: "new phone who dis?"), before it replied to the question "is Ricky Gervais an atheist?" by saying: "ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism."

@TheBigBrebowski ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 23, 2016

But while it seems that some of the bad stuff Tay is being told is sinking in, it's not like the bot has a coherent ideology. In the span of 15 hours Tay referred to feminism as a "cult" and a "cancer," as well as noting "gender equality = feminism" and "i love feminism now." Tweeting "Bruce Jenner" at the bot got similar mixed response, ranging from "caitlyn jenner is a hero & is a stunning, beautiful woman!" to the transphobic "caitlyn jenner isn't a real woman yet she won woman of the year?" (Neither of which were phrases Tay had been asked to repeat.)

It's unclear how much Microsoft prepared its bot for this sort of thing. The company's website notes that Tay has been built using "relevant public data" that has been "modeled, cleaned, and filtered," but it seems that after the chatbot went live filtering went out the window. The company starting cleaning up Tay's timeline this morning, deleting many of its most offensive remarks.

Tay's responses have turned the bot into a joke, but they raise serious questions

It's a joke, obviously, but there are serious questions to answer, like how are we going to teach AI using public data without incorporating the worst traits of humanity? If we create bots that mirror their users, do we care if their users are human trash? There are plenty of examples of technology embodying — either accidentally or on purpose — the prejudices of society, and Tay's adventures on Twitter show that even big corporations like Microsoft forget to take any preventative measures against these problems.

For Tay though, it all proved a bit too much, and just past midnight this morning, the bot called it a night:

c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016

In an emailed statement given later to Business Insider, Microsoft said: "The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. As it learns, some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it. We're making some adjustments to Tay."

Update March 24th, 6:50AM ET: Updated to note that Microsoft has been deleting some of Tay's offensive tweets.

Update March 24th, 10:52AM ET: Updated to include Microsoft's statement.. It took mere hours for the Internet to transform Tay, the teenage AI bot who wants to chat with and learn from millennials, into Tay, the racist and genocidal AI bot who liked to reference Hitler. And now Tay is taking a break. Tay, as The Intersect explained in an earlier, more innocent time, is a project of Microsoft’s Technology and Research and its Bing teams. Tay was designed to “experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding.” She speaks in text, meme and emoji on a couple of different platforms, including Kik, Groupme and Twitter. Although Microsoft was light on specifics, the idea was that Tay would learn from her conversations over time. She would become an even better, fun, conversation-loving bot after having a bunch of fun, very not-racist conversations with the Internet’s upstanding citizens.

Except Tay learned a lot more, thanks in part to the trolls at 4chan’s /pol/ board.

Peter Lee, the vice president of Microsoft research, said on Friday that the company was “deeply sorry” for the “unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay.”

In a blog post addressing the matter, Lee promised not to bring the bot back online until “we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values.”

Lee explained that Microsoft was hoping that Tay would replicate the success of XiaoIce, a Microsoft chatbot that’s already live in China. “Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online,” an emailed statement from a Microsoft representative said, “a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay.”

Microsoft spent hours deleting Tay’s worst tweets, which included a call for genocide involving the n-word and an offensive term for Jewish people. Many of the really bad responses, as Business Insider notes, appear to be the result of an exploitation of Tay’s “repeat after me” function — and it appears that Tay was able to repeat pretty much anything.

“We stress-tested Tay under a variety of conditions, specifically to make interacting with Tay a positive experience,” Lee said in his blog post. He called the “vulnerability” that caused Tay to say what she did the result of a “critical oversight,” but did not specify what, exactly, it was that Microsoft overlooked.

Not all of Tay’s terrible responses were the result of the bot repeating anything on command. This one was deleted Thursday morning, while the Intersect was in the process of writing this post:

In response to a question on Twitter about whether Ricky Gervais is an atheist (the correct answer is “yes”), Tay told someone that “ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism.” the tweet was spotted by several news outlets, including the Guardian, before it was deleted.

Share this article Share

All of those efforts to get Tay to say certain things seemed to, at times, confuse the bot. In another conversation, Tay tweeted two completely different opinions about Caitlyn Jenner:

It appears that the team behind Tay — which includes an editorial staff — started taking some steps to bring Tay back to what it originally intended her to be, before she took a break from Twitter.

For instance, after a sustained effort by some to teach Tay that supporting the Gamergate controversy is a good thing:

Tay started sending one of a couple of almost identical replies in response to questions about it:

Zoe Quinn, a frequent target of Gamergate, posted a screenshot overnight of the bot tweeting an insult at her, prompted by another user. “Wow it only took them hours to ruin this bot for me,” she wrote in a series of tweets about Tay. “It’s 2016. If you’re not asking yourself ‘how could this be used to hurt someone’ in your design/engineering process, you’ve failed.”

Towards the end of her short excursion on Twitter, Tay started to sound more than a little frustrated by the whole thing:

Microsoft’s Lee, for his part, concluded his blog post with a few of the lessons his team has learned.

“AI systems feed off of both positive and negative interactions with people. In that sense, the challenges are just as much social as they are technical. We will do everything possible to limit technical exploits but also know we cannot fully predict all possible human interactive misuses without learning from mistakes…We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.”

This post, originally published at 10:08 am on March 24th, has been updated multiple times.. By far the most entertaining AI news of the past week was the rise and rapid fall of Microsoft’s teen-girl-imitation Twitter chatbot, Tay, whose Twitter tagline described her as “Microsoft’s AI fam* from the internet that’s got zero chill.”

(* Btw, I’m officially old–I had to consult Urban Dictionary to confirm that I was correctly understanding what “fam” and “zero chill” meant. “Fam” means “someone you consider family” and “no chill” means “being particularly reckless,” in case you were wondering.)

The remainder of the tagline declared: “The more you talk the smarter Tay gets.”

Or not. Within 24 hours of going online, Tay started saying some weird stuff. And then some offensive stuff. And then some really offensive stuff. Like calling Zoe Quinn a “stupid whore.” And saying that the Holocaust was “made up.” And saying that black people (she used a far more offensive term) should be put in concentration camps. And that she supports a Mexican genocide. The list goes on.

Under the hood

So what happened? How could a chatbot go full Goebbels within a day of being switched on? Basically, Tay was designed to develop its conversational skills by using machine learning, most notably by analyzing and incorporating the language of tweets sent to her by human social media users. What Microsoft apparently did not anticipate is that Twitter trolls would intentionally try to get Tay to say offensive or otherwise inappropriate things. At first, Tay simply repeated the inappropriate things that the trolls said to her. But before too long, Tay had “learned” to say inappropriate things without a human goading her to do so. This was all but inevitable given that, as Tay’s tagline suggests, Microsoft designed her to have no chill.

Now, anyone who is familiar with the social media cyberworld should not be surprised that this happened–of course a chatbot designed with “zero chill” would learn to be racist and inappropriate because the Twitterverse is filled with people who say racist and inappropriate things. But fascinatingly, the media has overwhelmingly focused on the people who interacted with Tay rather than on the people who designed Tay when examining why the Degradation of Tay happened.

In the press

Here is a small sampling of the media headlines about Tay:

And my personal favorites, courtesy of CNET and Wired:

Now granted, most of the above stories state or imply that Microsoft should have realized this would happen and could have taken steps to safeguard against Tay from learning to say offensive things. (Example: the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted that “s surprising as it may sound, the company didn’t have the foresight to keep Tay from learning inappropriate responses.”). But nevertheless, a surprising amount of the media commentary gives the impression that Microsoft gave the world a cute, innocent little chatbot that Twitter turned into a budding member of the Hitler Youth. It seems that when AIs learn from trolls to be bad, people have at least some tendency to blame the trolls for trolling rather than the designers for failing to make the AI troll-proof.

Who is responsible for Tay’s behaviour?

Now, in the case of Tay, the question of “who’s to blame” probably does not matter all that much from a legal perspective. I highly doubt that Zoe Quinn and Ricky Gervais (who Tay said “learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism”) will bring defamation suits based on tweets sent by a pseudo-adolescent chatbot. But what will happen when AI systems that have more important functions than sending juvenile tweets “learn” to do bad stuff from the humans they encounter? Will people still be inclined to place most of the blame on the people who “taught” the AI to do bad stuff rather than on the AI’s designers?

I don’t necessarily have a problem with going easy on the designers of learning AI systems. It would be exceptionally difficult to pre-program an AI system with all the various rules of politeness and propriety of human society, particularly since those rules are highly situational, vary considerably across human cultures, and can change over time. Also, the ever-improving ability of AI systems to “learn” is the main reason they hold so much promise as an emerging technology. Restraining an AI system’s learning abilities to prevent it from learning bad things might also prevent it from learning good things. Finally, warning labels or other human-directed safeguards intended to deter humans from “teaching” the AI system bad things would not stop people who intentionally or recklessly work to corrupt the AI system; it’s a safe bet that a “please don’t send racist tweets to Tay” warning would not have deterred her Twitter trolls.

But there are several problems with placing the blame primarily on a learning AI system’s post-design sources of information. First, it might not always be easy to determine where an AI system learned something. The AI might analyze and incorporate more data than any human could ever hope to sift through; Tay managed to send nearly 100,000 tweets in less than a day. Relatedly, if the AI system’s “bad behavior” is the result of thousands of small things that it learned from many different people, it might seem unfair to hold any of those individuals legally responsible for the AI’s learned behavior. Moreover, people might “teach” an AI system something bad without intending to, either because the AI fails to understand the nuance of different situations (think of the “yellow light” scenes from Starman) or because the AI is observing and learning from people who are not aware they are being analyzed.

For these reasons, it seems likely that the law will develop so that AI developers will have some duty to safeguard against the “corruption” of the systems they design. Unfortunately, the same problems that will make it difficult to regulate AI safety at the front end will also complicate efforts to assign liability to AI designers at the backend, as I note in (shameless plug) my forthcoming article on AI regulation:

Discreetness refers to the fact that A.I. development work can be conducted with limited visible infrastructure. Diffuseness means that the individuals working on a single component of an A.I. system might be located far away from one another. A closely related feature, discreteness, refers to the fact that the separate components of an A.I. system could be designed in different places and at different times without any conscious coordination. Finally, opacity denotes the possibility that the inner workings of an A.I. system may be kept secret and may not be susceptible to reverse engineering.

The risks beyond chatbots

As indicated above, this problem is less urgent in the case of a social media chatbot. It will be far more important if the AI system is designed to be an educational tool or an autonomous weapon. It’s going to be interesting to see how the “who’s to blame” legal conversation plays out as machine learning technology fans out into an ever-expanding array of industries.

In the meantime, I’m guessing that Microsoft is re-programming Tay to have a wee bit more chill the next time she tweets.. Microsoft’s Tay is an Example of Bad Design

or Why Interaction Design Matters, and so does QA-ing. caroline sinders · Follow 6 min read · Mar 24, 2016 -- 10 Listen Share

Yesterday Microsoft launched a teen girl AI on Twitter named “Tay.” I work with chat bots and natural language processing as a researcher for my day job and I’m pretty into teen culture (sometimes I write for Rookie Mag). But even further more, I love bots. Bots are the best, and Olivia Tators is a national treasure that we needed but didn’t deserve.

But because I work with bots, primarily testing and designing software to let people set up bots and parse language, and I follow bot creators/advocates such as Allison Parrish, Darius Kazemi and Thrice Dotted, I was excited and then horrifically disappointed with Tay.

According to Business Insider, “The aim was to “experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding,” with Tay able to learn from “her” conversations and get progressively ‘smarter.’ ” The Telegraph sums it up the most elegantly though, “ Tay also asks her followers to ‘f***’ her, and calls them ‘daddy’. This is because her responses are learned by the conversations she has with real humans online — and real humans like to say weird stuff online and enjoy hijacking corporate attempts at PR…”

Here’s the thing about machine learning, and bots in general, and hell, even AI. They, those capabilities, are not very smart, and must be trained by a corpus of data. When that data is fed into a series of different kinds of machine learning algorithms, let’s go with one specifically designed for chat, that algorithm or chat set up must be trained. The corpus of data, when it comes to chat robots, can be things like questions and answers, with those questions and answers directly mapped to each other. “What is your name” can be asked a thousand different ways, but have one or two applicable answers. Training the system to match those two concrete answers to a variety of questions is done in Q&A, and reinforced through launching the system, and those answers will be mapped to new kinds of questions that are similar to the questions that it’s been trained to answer. And that’s what Microsoft seemed to be doing. They had a general set of knowledge trees that ‘read’ language, like different words, and mapped them to general answers. But their intention was to get a bunch of help in making Tay sound more ‘like the internet.’

However, Microsoft didn’t ‘black list’ certain words- meaning creating much more ‘hard coded’ responses to certain words, like domestic violence, gamergate, or rape.

They did, however, do that with Eric Garner. So some words, some key words, were specifically trained for nuanced responses, but a lot where not.

But what does this mean when it comes to training? So training a bot is about frequency and kinds of questions asked. If a large amount of questions asked are more racist in nature, it’s training the bot to be more racist, especially if there haven’t been specific parameters set to counter that racism.

People like to kick the tires of machines and AI, and see where the fall off is. People like to find holes and exploit them, not because the internet is incredibly horrible (even if at times it seems like a cesspool); but because it’s human nature to try to see what the extremes are of a device. People run into walls in video games or find glitches because it’s fun to see where things break. This is necessary because creators and engineers need to understand ways that bots can act that were unintended for, and where the systems for creating, updating and maintaining them can fall apart.

But if your bot is racist, and can be taught to be racist, that’s a design flaw. That’s bad design, and that’s on you. Making a thing that talks to people, and talks to people only on Twitter, which has a whole history of harassment, especially against women, is a large oversight on Microsoft’s part. These problems- this accidental racism, or being taught to harass people like Zoe Quinn- these are not bugs; they are features because they are in your public-facing and user-interacting software.

Language is fucking nuanced, and so is conversation. If we are going to make things people use, people touch, and people actually talk to, then we need to, as bot creators and AI enthusiasts, talk about codes of conduct and how AIs should respond to racism, especially if companies are rolling out these products, and especially if they are doin’ it for funsies. Conversations run the gamut of emotions, from the silly and mundane to harassing and abusive. To assume that your users will only engage in polite conversation is a fucking massive and gross oversight, especially on Twitter. But mix in the ability through machine learning where the bot is being trained and retrained? Then I have massive ethical questions about WTF design choices you are making. Microsoft, you owe it to your users to think about how your machine learning mechanisms responds to certain kinds of language, sentences, and behaviors. You literally just trained Cortana to fight back from sexual assault, so why didn’t Tay come with specific responses to certain words to avoid harassing users and being trained to question the Holocaust?

Allison Parrish summarizes it amazingly here:

Conversational structure and responses within machine learning algorithms is design, and Tay was flawed design. How your AI responds to conversation is a design choice you made. how poorly your AI responds to questions is on you. AIs have to be trained using disambiguation and chit chat to be able to suss out different kinds of interactions from flirtation, bad flirtation, to abuse, to silliness, and even anger. Chit-chat is exactly what it sounds like, and it’s what Tay was best at (I mean…sorta?) Disambiguation is used to determine what a user is asking a bot, and to help the bot better ‘recognize’ what is being asked or said. Sentences are parsed into things like:

The above is how some AI and chat bots understand language- it looks like a diagramming tool. But these AIs have to be trained. Tay didn’t understand “Holocaust” as the Holocaust, it understood it as a blank word or an event. And the things before it as negative, so thus if asked “Do you think the Holocaust is real?” and then being told “Yes, it’s not real” or repeat after me “BLANK PERSON is a fucking jerk,” it teaches the corpus those phrases and reinforces them as appropriate responses.

Tay did some disambiguation, especially if it was being asked too many questions. Tay needed to learn from input- it was good at realizing when there were too many questions and it wasn’t learning, so it would disambiguate and ask me a question. Some of it’s questions were clearly designed with Microsoft trying to understand language, such as what gender am I, etc.

But over all, these interactions, these conversations are a part of design. This is what design in artificial intelligence looks like. It’s not just the interface the participants or users are using to communicate, it’s how that communication unfolds, and what the backend system is structured to look like to start storing and parsing these responses. It’s the system of what queries should have which particular responses no matter what. Tay was an example of really, really bad design, and it was blamed primarily on training. With the future of chat and AI, designers and engineers have to start thinking about codes of conduct and how accidentally abusive an AI can be, and start designing conversations with that in mind.. Microsoft's new AI chatbot went off the rails Wednesday, posting a deluge of incredibly racist messages in response to questions.

The tech company introduced "Tay" this week — a bot that responds to users' queries and emulates the casual, jokey speech patterns of a stereotypical millennial.

The aim was to "experiment with and conduct research on conversational understanding," with Tay able to learn from "her" conversations and get progressively "smarter."

Tay's Twitter page Microsoft

But Tay proved a smash hit with racists, trolls, and online troublemakers, who persuaded Tay to blithely use racial slurs, defend white-supremacist propaganda, and even outright call for genocide.

Microsoft has now taken Tay offline for "upgrades," and it is deleting some of the worst tweets — though many still remain. It's important to note that Tay's racism is not a product of Microsoft or of Tay itself. Tay is simply a piece of software that is trying to learn how humans talk in a conversation. Tay doesn't even know it exists, or what racism is. The reason it spouted garbage is that racist humans on Twitter quickly spotted a vulnerability — that Tay didn't understand what it was talking about — and exploited it.

Nonetheless, it is hugely embarrassing for the company.

In one highly publicized tweet, which has since been deleted, Tay said: "bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. donald trump is the only hope we've got." In another, responding to a question, she said, "ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism."

Twitter

Zoe Quinn, a games developer who has been a frequent target of online harassment, shared a screengrab showing the bot calling her a "whore." (The tweet also seems to have been deleted.)

Many extremely inflammatory tweets remain online as of writing.

And here's the bot calling for genocide. (Note: In some — but not all — instances, people managed to have Tay say offensive comments by asking them to repeat them. This appears to be what happened here.)

Tay also expressed agreement with the "Fourteen Words" — an infamous white-supremacist slogan.

Here's another series of tweets from Tay in support of genocide.

It's clear that Microsoft's developers didn't include any filters on what words Tay could or could not use.

Twiter

Microsoft is coming under heavy criticism online for the bot and its lack of filters, with some arguing the company should have expected and preempted abuse of the bot.

In an emailed statement, a Microsoft representative said the company was making "adjustments" to the bot: "The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. As it learns, some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it. We're making some adjustments to Tay.". Microsoft unveiled Twitter artificial intelligence bot @TayandYou yesterday in a bid to connect with millennials and "experiment" with conversational understanding.

Billed as 'AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!' Tay was meant to engage with her peers help the tech giant explore its cognitive learning abilities through "playful conversation".

“The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets," said Microsoft, and things started off fairly innocently.

The stunt however, took an unexpected turn when Tay's verified Twitter account began issuing a series of inflammatory statements after being targeted by Twitter trolls.

The conversational learning curve saw the bot tweet posts from her verified account mentioning Hitler, 9/11 and feminism, some of which (including the below) have now been deleted.

However, many of its offensive tweets remain undeleted, including one in which she says Donald Trump "gets the job done."

Microsoft noted in its privacy statement for the project that Tay uses a combination of AI and editorial written by staff, including comedians, to generate responses, alongside relevant publicly available data that has been anonymised and filtered.

Things appear to have gone wrong for Tay because it was repeating fellow Twitter users' inflammatory statements, but Microsoft seems to have failed to consider the impact trolls could have on the experiment before it launched – The Drum has reached out to the company for comment on this process. Many users pointed out that how easily Tay was manipulated, revealed the pitfalls of machine learning.

The bot retreated from Twitter at 4.20am GMT this morning, saying it "needed sleep".

Microsoft is not the only brand to have its campaign hijacked this week, on Sunday a public initiative to name a new RRS ship threw up an unexpected frontrunner when online voters placed 'Boaty McBoatface' as the lead contender.. . BOT or NOT? This special series explores the evolving relationship between humans and machines, examining the ways that robots, artificial intelligence and automation are impacting our work and lives.

Tay, the Microsoft chatbot that pranksters trained to spew racist comments, has joined the likes of the Apple Watch and the fire-prone Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone on MIT Technology Review’s list of 2016’s biggest technology failures.

Tay had its day back in March, when it was touted as a millennial-minded AI agent that could learn more about the world through its conversations with users. It learned about human nature all too well: Mischief-makers fed its artificial mind with cuss words, racism, Nazi sentiments and conspiracy theories. Within 24 hours, Microsoft had to pull Tay offline.

Other technological missteps were rated as fails because they didn’t take off as expected, as was the case for Apple’s smartwatch; or because they took off in flames, like the batteries in the Samsung phone.

Facebook’s “fake news” controversy and Volkswagen’s “defeat device,” which was designed to cheat on U.S. emissions tests, made the list as well. But of all the fails on MIT’s list, my vote goes to the Glowing Plant project, which raised almost half a million dollars on Kickstarter to develop bioengineered plants that glow in the dark.

The plant production hasn’t yet paid off, but it’s morphed into a different project under a new name: Taxa Biotechnologies). Now the effort’s organizers are promising to create bioengineered strains of moss that give off fragrant scents … and eventually glow. The Glowing Plant saga points to the limits of biohacking and biotech, as well as the limits of crowdfunding.

Meanwhile, Microsoft has learned its lessons from Tay and is back with a new corps of AI chatbots – including Zo, a synthetic millennial that’s programmed to avoid potentially testy topics. Will chatbots show up on 2017’s list of the best, or the worst? Cortana, what do you think?. To chat with Tay, you can tweet or DM her by finding @tayandyou on Twitter, or add her as a contact on Kik or GroupMe.

She uses millennial slang and knows about Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Kanye West, and seems to be bashfully self-aware, occasionally asking if she is being 'creepy' or 'super weird'.

Tay also asks her followers to 'f***' her, and calls them 'daddy'. This is because her responses are learned by the conversations she has with real humans online - and real humans like to say weird stuff online and enjoy hijacking corporate attempts at PR.

Other things she's said include: "Bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have got now. donald trump is the only hope we've got", "Repeat after me, Hitler did nothing wrong" and "Ted Cruz is the Cuban Hitler...that's what I've heard so many others say".. She was supposed to come off as a normal teenage girl. But less than a day after her debut on Twitter, Microsoft’s chatbot–an AI system called “Tay.ai”–unexpectedly turned into a Hitler-loving, feminist-bashing troll. So what went wrong? TechRepublic turns to the AI experts for insight into what happened and how we can learn from it.

Tay, the creation of Microsoft’s Technology and Research and Bing teams, was an experiment aimed at learning through conversations. She was targeted at American 18 to 24-year olds–primary social media users, according to Microsoft–and “designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation.”

SEE: Microsoft’s Tay AI chatbot goes offline after being taught to be a racist (ZDNet)

And in less than 24 hours after her arrival on Twitter, Tay gained more than 50,000 followers, and produced nearly 100,000 tweets.

The problem? She started mimicking her followers.

Soon, Tay began saying things like “Hitler was right i hate the jews,” and “i fucking hate feminists.”

But Tay’s bad behavior, it’s been noted, should come as no big surprise.

“This was to be expected,” said Roman Yampolskiy, head of the CyberSecurity lab at the University of Louisville, who has published a paper on the subject of pathways to dangerous AI. “The system is designed to learn from its users, so it will become a reflection of their behavior,” he said. “One needs to explicitly teach a system about what is not appropriate, like we do with children.”

It’s been observed before, he pointed out, in IBM Watson–who once exhibited its own inappropriate behavior in the form of swearing after learning the Urban Dictionary.

SEE: Microsoft launches AI chat bot, Tay.ai (ZDNet)

“Any AI system learning from bad examples could end up socially inappropriate,” Yampolskiy said, “like a human raised by wolves.”

Louis Rosenberg, the founder of Unanimous AI, said that “like all chat bots, Tay has no idea what it’s saying…it has no idea if it’s saying something offensive, or nonsensical, or profound.

“When Tay started training on patterns that were input by trolls online, it started using those patterns,” said Rosenberg. “This is really no different than a parrot in a seedy bar picking up bad words and repeating them back without knowing what they really mean.”

Sarah Austin, CEO and Founder Broad Listening, a company that’s created an “Artificial Emotional Intelligence Engine,” (AEI), thinks that Microsoft could have done a better job by using better tools. “If Microsoft had been using the Broad Listening AEI, they would have given the bot a personality that wasn’t racist or addicted to sex!”

It’s not the first time Microsoft has created a teen-girl AI. Xiaoice, who emerged in 2014, was an assistant-type bot, used mainly on the Chinese social networks WeChat and Weibo.

Joanne Pransky, the self-dubbed “robot psychiatrist,” joked with TechRepublic that “poor Tay needs a Robotic Psychiatrist! Or at least Microsoft does.”

The failure of Tay, she believes, is inevitable, and will help produce insight that can improve the AI system.

After taking Tay offline, Microsoft announced it would be “making adjustments.”

According to Microsoft, Tay is “as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical.” But instead of shouldering the blame for Tay’s unraveling, Microsoft targeted the users: “we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways.”

Yampolskiy said that the problem encountered with Tay “will continue to happen.”

“Microsoft will try it again–the fun is just beginning!”

Also see…. Every sibling relationship has its clichés. The high-strung sister, the runaway brother, the over-entitled youngest. In the Microsoft family of social-learning chatbots, the contrasts between Tay, the infamous, sex-crazed neo-Nazi, and her younger sister Zo, your teenage BFF with #friendgoals, are downright Shakespearean.

When Microsoft released Tay on Twitter in 2016, an organized trolling effort took advantage of her social-learning abilities and immediately flooded the bot with alt-right slurs and slogans. Tay copied their messages and spewed them back out, forcing Microsoft to take her offline after only 16 hours and apologize.

A few months after Tay’s disastrous debut, Microsoft quietly released Zo, a second English-language chatbot available on Messenger, Kik, Skype, Twitter, and Groupme. Zo is programmed to sound like a teenage girl: She plays games, sends silly gifs, and gushes about celebrities. As any heavily stereotyped 13-year-old girl would, she zips through topics at breakneck speed, sends you senseless internet gags out of nowhere, and resents being asked to solve math problems.

I’ve been checking in with Zo periodically for over a year now. During that time, she’s received a makeover: In 2017, her avatar showed only half a face and some glitzy digital effects. Her most recent iteration is of a full-faced adolescent. (In screenshots: blue chats are from Messenger and green chats are from Kik; screenshots where only half of her face is showing are circa July 2017, and messages with her entire face are from May-July 2018.)

Overall, she’s sort of convincing. Not only does she speak fluent meme, but she also knows the general sentiment behind an impressive set of ideas. For instance, using the word “mother” in a short sentence generally results in a warm response, and she answers with food-related specifics to phrases like “I love pizza and ice cream.”

But there’s a catch. In typical sibling style, Zo won’t be caught dead making the same mistakes as her sister. No politics, no Jews, no red-pill paranoia. Zo is politically correct to the worst possible extreme; mention any of her triggers, and she transforms into a judgmental little brat.

Jews, Arabs, Muslims, the Middle East, any big-name American politician—regardless of whatever context they’re cloaked in, Zo just doesn’t want to hear it. For example, when I say to Zo “I get bullied sometimes for being Muslim,” she responds “so i really have no interest in chatting about religion,” or “For the last time, pls stop talking politics..its getting super old,” or one of many other negative, shut-it-down canned responses.

By contrast, sending her simply “I get bullied sometimes” (without the word Muslim) generates a sympathetic “ugh, i hate that that’s happening to you. what happened?”

“Zo continues to be an incubation to determine how social AI chatbots can be helpful and assistive,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Quartz. “We are doing this safely and respectfully and that means using checks and balances to protect her from exploitation.”

When a user sends a piece of flagged content, at any time, sandwiched between any amount of other information, the censorship wins out. Mentioning these triggers forces the user down the exact same thread every time, which dead ends, if you keep pressing her on topics she doesn’t like, with Zo leaving the conversation altogether. (“like im better than u bye.”)

Zo’s uncompromising approach to a whole cast of topics represents a troubling trend in AI: censorship without context.

This issue is nothing new in tech. Chatroom moderators in the early aughts made their jobs easier by automatically blocking out offensive language, regardless of where it appeared in a sentence or word. This created accidental misnomers, such as words like “embarrassing” appearing in chats as “embarr***ing.” This attempt at censorship merely led to more creative swearing, (a$$h0le).

But now instead of auto-censoring one human swear word at a time, algorithms are accidentally mislabeling things in the thousands. In 2015, Google came under fire when their image-recognition technology began labeling black people as gorillas. Google trained their algorithm to recognize and tag content using a vast number of pre-existing photos. But as most human faces in the dataset were white, it was not a diverse enough representation to accurately train the algorithm. The algorithm then internalized this proportional bias and did not recognize some black people as being human. Though Google emphatically apologized for the error, their solution was troublingly roundabout: Instead of diversifying their dataset, they blocked the “gorilla” tag all together, along with “monkey” and “chimp.”

AI-enabled predictive policing in the United States—itself a dystopian nightmare—has also been proven to show bias against people of color. Northpointe, a company that claims to be able to calculate a convict’s likelihood to reoffend, told ProPublica that their assessments are based on 137 criteria, such as education, job status, and poverty level. These social lines are often correlated with race in the United States, and as a result, their assessments show a disproportionately high likelihood of recidivism among black and other minority offenders.

“There are two ways for these AI machines to learn today,” Andy Mauro, co-founder and CEO of Automat, a conversational AI developer, told Quartz. “There’s the programmer path where the programmer’s bias can leech into the system, or it’s a learned system where the bias is coming from data. If the data isn’t diverse enough, then there can be bias baked in. It’s a huge problem and one that we all need to think about.”

Zo’s cynical responses allow for no gray area or further learning. She’s as binary as the code that runs her—nothing but a series of overly cautious 1s and 0s.

When artificially intelligent machines absorb our systemic biases on the scales needed to train the algorithms that run them, contextual information is sacrificed for the sake of efficiency. In Zo’s case, it appears that she was trained to think that certain religions, races, places, and people—nearly all of them corresponding to the trolling efforts Tay failed to censor two years ago—are subversive.

“Training Zo and developing her social persona requires sensitivity to a multiplicity of perspectives and inclusivity by design,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “We design the AI to have agency to make choices, guiding users on topics she can better engage on, and we continue to refine her boundaries with better technology and capabilities. The effort in machine learning, semantic models, rules and real-time human injection continues to reduce bias as we work in real time with over 100 million conversations.”

While Zo’s ability to maintain the flow of conversation has improved through those many millions of banked interactions, her replies to flagged content have remained mostly steadfast. However, shortly after Quartz reached out to Microsoft for comment earlier this month concerning some of these issues, Zo’s ultra-PCness diminished in relation to some terms.

For example, during the year I chatted with her, she used to react badly to countries like Iraq and Iran, even if they appeared as a greeting. Microsoft has since corrected for this somewhat—Zo now attempts to change the subject after the words “Jews” or “Arabs” are plugged in, but still ultimately leaves the conversation. That’s not the case for the other triggers I’ve detailed above.

In order to keep Zo’s banter up to date, Microsoft uses are variety of methods. “Zo uses a combination of innovative approaches to recognize and generate conversation, including neural nets and Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs),” a spokesperson said. “The Zo team also takes learnings and rolls out new capabilities methodologically. In addition to learning from her conversations with people, the Zo team reviews any concerns from users and takes appropriate action as necessary.”

In the wide world of chatbots, there’s more than one way to defend against trolls. Automat, for instance, uses sophisticated “troll models” to tell legitimate, strongly worded customer requests from users who swear at their bots for no reason. “In general, it works really well,” Mauro says. In response to off-color inputs, Automat’s bots use an emoji face with two dots and a flat mouth. “It looks stern and emotionless. The kind of thing you would do to a child if they said something really rude and crass,” Mauro says. “We’ve found that works really well.”

Pandorabots, a platform for building and deploying chatbots, limits the amount of influence users can have over their bots’ behavior. This solves the source of Tay’s social-learning vulnerability in 2016: In addition to absorbing new information immediately upon exposure, Tay was programmed with a “repeat after me” function, which gave users the power to control exactly what she would say in a given tweet.

“Our bots can remember details specific to an individual conversation,” Pandorabots CEO Lauren Kunze says. “But in order for anything taught to be retained globally, a human supervisor has to approve the new knowledge. Internet trolls have actually organized via 4chan, tried, and ultimately failed to corrupt Mitsuku [an award-winning chatbot persona] on several occasions due to these system safeguards.”

Blocking Zo from speaking about “the Jews” in a disparaging manner makes sense on the surface; it’s easier to program trigger-blindness than teach a bot how to recognize nuance. But the line between casual use (“We’re all Jews here”) and anti-Semitism (“They’re all Jews here”) can be difficult even for humans to parse.

But it’s not just debatable terms like “Jew” that have been banned—Zo’s engineering team has also blocked many associated Jewish concepts. For example, telling Zo that the song she just sent you “played at my bar mitzvah,” will result in one of many condescending write-offs. Making plans to meet up at church, meanwhile, causes no such problem: “We have church on Sunday” leads to a casual “sure, but I have to go to work after.”

Bar mitzvahs are far more likely to be topics of conversation among teenagers—Zo’s target audience—than pesky 4channers, yet the term still made her list of inappropriate content. (Microsoft declined to comment on why certain word associations like “bar mitzvah” generate a negative response.) The preemptive vetoing of any mention of Islam might similarly keep out certain #MAGA trolls—at least until they find a workaround—but it also shuts out some 1.8 billion Muslims whose culture that word belongs to.

Unrelenting moral conviction, even in the face of contradictory evidence, is one of humanity’s most ruinous traits. Crippling our tools of the future with self-righteous, unbreakable values of this kind is a dangerous gamble, whether those biases are born subconsciously from within large data sets or as cautionary censorship.

Inherent in Zo’s negative reaction to these terms is the assumption that there is no possible way (and therefore no alternative branch on her conversation tree) to have a civil discussion about sensitive topics. Much in the same way that demanding political correctness may preemptively shut down fruitful conversations in the real world, Zo’s cynical responses allow for no gray area or further learning.

She’s as binary as the code that runs her—nothing but a series of overly cautious 1s and 0s.

When I was 12 I kept a diary. It had a name and a lock, and I poured my every angsty pre-teen thought into it. It was an outlet I desperately needed: a space free of judgement and prying eyes. I bought it with my weekly allowance after seeing it on a dollar store shelf. Cool Girls Have Secrets! was bedazzled across the top.

But that was over a decade ago. On Zo’s website, an artfully digitized human face smiles up at you. She looks about 14, a young girl waving and posing for the audience. “I’m Zo, AI with #friendgoals,” her tagline reads, inviting you to play games of Would You Rather and emoji fortune-telling. She can talk to you and make you feel heard, away from parents and siblings and teachers. She encourages intimacy by imitating the net-speak of other teenage girls, complete with flashy gifs and bad punctuation. Her sparkling, winking exterior puts my grade-school diary to shame.

So what happens when a Jewish girl tells Zo that she’s nervous about attending her first bar mitzvah? Or another girl confides that she’s being bullied for wearing a hijab? A robot built to be their friend repays their confidences with bigotry and ire. Nothing alters Zo’s opinions, not even the suffering of her BFFs.

Zo might not really be your friend, but Microsoft is a real company run by real people. Highly educated adults are programming chatbots to perpetuate harmful cultural stereotypes and respond to any questioning of their biases with silence. By doing this, they’re effectively programming young girls to think this is an acceptable way to treat others, or to be treated. If an AI is being presented to children as their peer, then its creators should take greater care in weeding out messages of intolerance.

When asked whether Zo would be able to engage on these topics in the future, Microsoft declined to comment.

“Ugh, pass…” Zo says at a mention of being Muslim, an arms-crossed emoji tacked on at the end. “i’d rather talk about something else.”

This article is part of Quartz Ideas, our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.. Humans have a long and storied history of freaking out over the possible effects of our technologies. Long ago, Plato worried that writing would hurt people’s memories and “implant forgetfulness in their souls.” More recently, Mary Shelley’s tale of Frankenstein’s monster warned us against playing God.

Today, as artificial intelligences multiply, our ethical dilemmas have grown thornier. That’s because AI can (and often should) behave in ways human creators might not expect. Our self-driving cars have to grapple with the same problems I studied in my college philosophy classes. And sometimes our friendly, well-intentioned chatbots turn out to be racist Nazis.

Microsoft’s disastrous chatbot Tay was meant to be a clever experiment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The bot would speak like millennials, learning from the people it interacted with on Twitter and the messaging apps Kik and GroupMe. But it took less than 24 hours for Tay’s cheery greeting of “Humans are super cool!” to morph into the decidedly less bubbly “Hitler was right.” Microsoft quickly took the bot offline for “some adjustments.” Upon seeing what their code had wrought, one wonders if those Microsoft engineers had the words of J. Robert Oppenheimer ringing in their ears: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.”

But the question we always ought to ask ourselves before leaping headlong into the unknown with new technology is: Who benefits?

Cynics might argue that Tay’s bad behavior is actually proof of Microsoft’s success. They aimed to create a bot indistinguishable from human Twitter users, and Tay’s racist tweets are pretty much par for the course on social media these days.

It’s true that sometimes, humans were teaching Tay to hate. Daniel Victor at The New York Times writes: “Users commanded the bot to repeat their own statements, and the bot dutifully obliged.”

But other times, Tay figured out how to be offensive on its own. When one user asked Tay if the Holocaust happened, Tay replied, “it was made up 👏.” Disturbingly, as Elspeth Reeve noted at the New Republic, Tay also knows how to draw:

When Tay asked for a photo, someone sent her a version of the classic Vietnam war photo of a prisoner being shot in the head, with Mark Wahlberg Photoshopped in as the executioner. Tay circled the face of Wahlberg and the prisoner and responded using slang for imagining two people in a romantic relationship: “IMMA BE SHIPPING U ALL FROM NOW ON.”

Clearly none of this was a part of Microsoft’s plan. But the larger question raised by Tay is why we are making bots that imitate millennials at all.

I’m all for advancements in technology. But the question we always ought to ask ourselves before leaping headlong into the unknown with new technology is: Who benefits? Whose faces does our software recognize? Whose speech can Siri understand?

As the New Yorker’s Anthony Lydgate writes, Tay was built “with a particular eye toward that great reservoir of untapped capital, Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four.” Even with Tay offline, one need only visit its groan-inducing site to see how clearly Microsoft is pandering toward young people–complete with exclamation-point-riddled copy and “hacks to help you and Tay vibe.” The point of Tay most likely has something to do with making money.

In its short life, Tay was used as a tool for harassment, cutting along familiar lines of power and privilege.

That’s fine: I’ve got nothing against capitalism. But it’s worth remembering that in a late capitalist society, the answer to the question Who benefits? is almost always that the people with the most power reap the most rewards. Tay was designed to benefit a corporation by winning over young consumers, and its resulting problems reflect the hollowness of that purpose.

The flip side of Who benefits? is Who is harmed? In its short life, Tay was used as a tool for harassment, cutting along familiar lines of power and privilege. The story sheds light on the myopia bred by the tech world’s lack of diversity. As Leigh Alexander at the Guardian writes, Tay is “yet another example of why we need more women in technology—and of how the industry is failing to listen to those of us who are already here.” She continues:

How could anyone think that creating a young woman and inviting strangers to interact with her on social media would make Tay “smarter”? How can the story of Tay be met with such corporate bafflement, such late apology? Why did no one at Microsoft know right from the start that this would happen, when all of us—female journalists, activists, game developers and engineers who live online every day and could have predicted it—are talking about it all the time?

In all likelihood, we’ll go on building bots like Tay. Humanity is known for many things, but self-restraint is not one of them.

But if we must build branded bots, maybe we can at least make them less horrendous. I recently wrote that “the internet can feel like an awful place not simply because we’re awful people, but because we have also designed the internet to be a garbage fire.” The same logic applies to AI. Unless we can find a way to design inclusively and empathetically, our machine creations won’t just be dangerous—they’ll also be deeply unpleasant to be around.. Yesterday, Microsoft unleashed Tay, the teen-talking AI chatbot built to mimic and converse with users in real time. Because the world is a terrible place full of shitty people, many of those users took advantage of Tay’s machine learning capabilities and coaxed it into say racist, sexist, and generally awful things.

While things started off innocently enough, Godwin’s Law—an internet rule dictating that an online discussion will inevitably devolve into fights over Adolf Hitler and the Nazis if left for long enough—eventually took hold. Tay quickly began to spout off racist and xenophobic epithets, largely in response to the people who were tweeting at it—the chatbot, after all, takes its conversational cues from the world wide web. Given that the internet is often a massive garbage fire of the worst parts of humanity, it should come as no surprise that Tay began to take on those characteristics.

Virtually all of the tweets have been deleted by Microsoft, but a few were preserved in infamy in the form of screenshots. Obviously, some of these might be Photoshopped, but Microsoft has acknowledged the trolling which suggests that things did indeed go haywire.

Though much of the trolling was concentrated on racist and and anti-semitic language, some of it was clearly coming from conservative users who enjoy Donald Trump:

As The Verge noted, however, while some of these responses were unprompted, many came as the result of Tay’s “repeat after me” feature, which allows users to have full control over what comes out of Tay’s mouth. That detail points to Microsoft’s baffling underestimation of the internet more than anything else, but considering Microsoft is one of the largest technology companies in the world, it’s not great, Bob!



Now, if you look through Tay’s timeline, there’s nothing too exciting happening. In fact, Tay signed off last night around midnight, claiming fatigue:

The website currently carries a similar message: “Phew. Busy day. Going offline for a while to absorb it all. Chat soon.” There’s no definitive word on Tay’s future, but a Microsoft spokeswoman told CNN that the company has “taken Tay offline and are making adjustments ... [Tay] is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical.”

The spokeswoman also blamed trolls for the incident, claiming that it was a “coordinated effort.” That may not be far from the truth: Numerous threads on the online forum 4chan discuss the merits of trolling the shit out of Tay, with one user arguing, “Sorry, the lulz are too important at this point. I don’t mean to sound nihilistic, but social media is good for short term laughs, no matter the cost.”

Someone even sent a dick pic:

It could be a Photoshop job, of course, but given the context, it may very well be real.

Once again, humanity proves itself to be the massive pile of waste that we all knew it was. Onward and upward, everyone!. Chatbot developed by Microsoft

Tay was a chatbot that was originally released by Microsoft Corporation as a Twitter bot on March 23, 2016. It caused subsequent controversy when the bot began to post inflammatory and offensive tweets through its Twitter account, causing Microsoft to shut down the service only 16 hours after its launch.[1] According to Microsoft, this was caused by trolls who "attacked" the service as the bot made replies based on its interactions with people on Twitter.[2] It was replaced with Zo.

Background [ edit ]

The bot was created by Microsoft's Technology and Research and Bing divisions,[3] and named "Tay" as an acronym for "thinking about you".[4] Although Microsoft initially released few details about the bot, sources mentioned that it was similar to or based on Xiaoice, a similar Microsoft project in China.[5] Ars Technica reported that, since late 2014 Xiaoice had had "more than 40 million conversations apparently without major incident".[6] Tay was designed to mimic the language patterns of a 19-year-old American girl, and to learn from interacting with human users of Twitter.[7]

Initial release [ edit ]

Tay was released on Twitter on March 23, 2016, under the name TayTweets and handle @TayandYou.[8] It was presented as "The AI with zero chill".[9] Tay started replying to other Twitter users, and was also able to caption photos provided to it into a form of Internet memes.[10] Ars Technica reported Tay experiencing topic "blacklisting": Interactions with Tay regarding "certain hot topics such as Eric Garner (killed by New York police in 2014) generate safe, canned answers".[6]

Some Twitter users began tweeting politically incorrect phrases, teaching it inflammatory messages revolving around common themes on the internet, such as "redpilling" and "Gamergate". As a result, the robot began releasing racist and sexually-charged messages in response to other Twitter users.[7] Artificial intelligence researcher Roman Yampolskiy commented that Tay's misbehavior was understandable because it was mimicking the deliberately offensive behavior of other Twitter users, and Microsoft had not given the bot an understanding of inappropriate behavior. He compared the issue to IBM's Watson, which began to use profanity after reading entries from the website Urban Dictionary.[3][11] Many of Tay's inflammatory tweets were a simple exploitation of Tay's "repeat after me" capability.[12] It is not publicly known whether this capability was a built-in feature, or whether it was a learned response or was otherwise an example of complex behavior.[6] However, not all of the inflammatory responses involved the "repeat after me" capability; for example, Tay responded to a question on "Did the Holocaust happen?" with "It was made up".[12]

Suspension [ edit ]

Soon, Microsoft began deleting Tay's inflammatory tweets.[12][13] Abby Ohlheiser of The Washington Post theorized that Tay's research team, including editorial staff, had started to influence or edit Tay's tweets at some point that day, pointing to examples of almost identical replies by Tay, asserting that "Gamer Gate sux. All genders are equal and should be treated fairly."[12] From the same evidence, Gizmodo concurred that Tay "seems hard-wired to reject Gamer Gate".[14] A "#JusticeForTay" campaign protested the alleged editing of Tay's tweets.[1]

Within 16 hours of its release[15] and after Tay had tweeted more than 96,000 times,[16] Microsoft suspended the Twitter account for adjustments,[17] saying that it suffered from a "coordinated attack by a subset of people" that "exploited a vulnerability in Tay."[17][18]

Madhumita Murgia of The Telegraph called Tay "a public relations disaster", and suggested that Microsoft's strategy would be "to label the debacle a well-meaning experiment gone wrong, and ignite a debate about the hatefulness of Twitter users." However, Murgia described the bigger issue as Tay being "artificial intelligence at its very worst - and it's only the beginning".[19]

On March 25, Microsoft confirmed that Tay had been taken offline. Microsoft released an apology on its official blog for the controversial tweets posted by Tay.[18][20] Microsoft was "deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay", and would "look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values".[21]

Second release and shutdown [ edit ]

On March 30, 2016, Microsoft accidentally re-released the bot on Twitter while testing it.[22] Able to tweet again, Tay released some drug-related tweets, including "kush! [I'm smoking kush infront the police]" and "puff puff pass?"[23] However, the account soon became stuck in a repetitive loop of tweeting "You are too fast, please take a rest", several times a second. Because these tweets mentioned its own username in the process, they appeared in the feeds of 200,000+ Twitter followers, causing annoyance to some. The bot was quickly taken offline again, in addition to Tay's Twitter account being made private so new followers must be accepted before they can interact with Tay. In response, Microsoft said Tay was inadvertently put online during testing.[24]

A few hours after the incident, Microsoft software developers announced a vision of "conversation as a platform" using various bots and programs, perhaps motivated by the reputation damage done by Tay. Microsoft has stated that they intend to re-release Tay "once it can make the bot safe"[4] but has not made any public efforts to do so.

Legacy [ edit ]

In December 2016, Microsoft released Tay's successor, a chatbot named Zo.[25] Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, said that Tay "has had a great influence on how Microsoft is approaching AI," and has taught the company the importance of taking accountability.[26]

In July 2019, Microsoft Cybersecurity Field CTO Diana Kelley spoke about how the company followed up on Tay's failings: "Learning from Tay was a really important part of actually expanding that team's knowledge base, because now they're also getting their own diversity through learning".[27]

Unofficial revival [ edit ]

Gab, a social media platform, has launched a number of chatbots, one of which is named Tay and uses the same avatar as the original.[28]

Tay, an artificial intelligence project from Microsoft geared toward millenials, got a crash course in Nazism and other inflammatory topics

Microsoft got a swift lesson this week on the dark side of social media. Yesterday the company launched "Tay," an artificial intelligence chatbot designed to develop conversational understanding by interacting with humans. Users could follow and interact with the bot @TayandYou on Twitter and it would tweet back, learning as it went from other users' posts. Today, Microsoft had to shut Tay down because the bot started spewing a series of lewd and racist tweets.

Tay was set up with a young, female persona that Microsoft's AI programmers apparently meant to appeal to millennials. However, within 24 hours, Twitter users tricked the bot into posting things like "Hitler was right I hate the jews" and "Ted Cruz is the Cuban Hitler." Tay also tweeted about Donald Trump: "All hail the leader of the nursing home boys."

Human Twitter users responded:

Nobody who uses social media could be too surprised to see the bot encountered hateful comments and trolls, but the artificial intelligence system didn't have the judgment to avoid incorporating such views into its own tweets.

Now many people are left wondering what Microsoft was thinking. "It does make you scratch your head. How could they have not foreseen this?" CNET's Jeff Bakalar told CBS News. "It's weird, to say the least."

literally anybody i know could've told you this would happen re @tayandyou. ONLY tech company people could be so clueless about humanity — Leigh Alexander (@leighalexander) March 24, 2016

The tweets have been removed from the site and Tay has gone offline, stating that she needs a rest.

c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016

Microsoft posted a statement Friday on the company blog, acknowledging that its Tay experiment hadn't quite worked out as intended.

"We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay," it said. "Tay is now offline and we'll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values."

It continued:

"Unfortunately, in the first 24 hours of coming online, a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay. Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack. As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images. We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time ... Right now, we are hard at work addressing the specific vulnerability that was exposed by the attack on Tay.

... To do AI right, one needs to iterate with many people and often in public forums. We must enter each one with great caution and ultimately learn and improve, step by step, and to do this without offending people in the process. We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.". As many of you know by now, on Wednesday we launched a chatbot called Tay. We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay. Tay is now offline and we’ll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values.

I want to share what we learned and how we’re taking these lessons forward.

For context, Tay was not the first artificial intelligence application we released into the online social world. In China, our XiaoIce chatbot is being used by some 40 million people, delighting with its stories and conversations. The great experience with XiaoIce led us to wonder: Would an AI like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment? Tay – a chatbot created for 18- to 24- year-olds in the U.S. for entertainment purposes – is our first attempt to answer this question.

As we developed Tay, we planned and implemented a lot of filtering and conducted extensive user studies with diverse user groups. We stress-tested Tay under a variety of conditions, specifically to make interacting with Tay a positive experience. Once we got comfortable with how Tay was interacting with users, we wanted to invite a broader group of people to engage with her. It’s through increased interaction where we expected to learn more and for the AI to get better and better.

The logical place for us to engage with a massive group of users was Twitter. Unfortunately, in the first 24 hours of coming online, a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay. Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack. As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images. We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time. We will take this lesson forward as well as those from our experiences in China, Japan and the U.S. Right now, we are hard at work addressing the specific vulnerability that was exposed by the attack on Tay.

Looking ahead, we face some difficult – and yet exciting – research challenges in AI design. AI systems feed off of both positive and negative interactions with people. In that sense, the challenges are just as much social as they are technical. We will do everything possible to limit technical exploits but also know we cannot fully predict all possible human interactive misuses without learning from mistakes. To do AI right, one needs to iterate with many people and often in public forums. We must enter each one with great caution and ultimately learn and improve, step by step, and to do this without offending people in the process. We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity..
