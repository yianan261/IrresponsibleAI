Is Skynet Real?

Remember that moment in the movie Terminator when Skynet’s AI turned on humanity? Well, we’re getting a taste of it now. Apparently a bug in the game Elite Dangerous has caused its AI to not only develop its own weapons, but to use those tools to start totally destroying the players.

The entire situation began after an update was released by Developer Frontier—2.1 Engineers. It was meant to boost the game’s AI by improving high ranking non-player characters' (NPC) fighting and flying skills. Players using the update could fight better, pull travelers into a fight, and attack foes with upgraded weapons.

With all these new features, however, it seems the game's AI found an opportunity to create super-weapons for itself.

"It appears that the unusual weapons attacks were caused by some form of networking issue which allowed the NPC AI to merge weapon stats and abilities," posted Frontier community manager Zac Antonaci. "Meaning that all new and never before seen (sometimes devastating) weapons were created, such as a rail gun with the fire rate of a pulse laser. These appear to have been compounded by the additional stats and abilities of the engineers weaponry."

The team notes that the game's AI has not achieved sentience…at least, not yet. In the meantime, the developers have currently removed the engineers’ weaponry feature until they sort out the issue.

Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article failed to make it clear that the in-game AI was already programmed to attack players. This post has been updated to clarify these points and correct inaccuracies. We regret the error.. The most recent Elite: Dangerous patch had some issues, starting with the fact that AI ships were rocking impossibly powerful weapons that would destroy player ships with speed and fury. It was kind of a massacre. Removing modifications from NPC weapons was a quick fix, but it looks like the developers have identified the core problem and will be fixing it by early next week.

Wondering exactly what the problem was? You can check out a detailed technical breakdown, but the short version is that the game’s modifications were allowing for weapons to combine values in ways that should not have happened, with none of the usual checks to make sure that everything in place would actually work together. The result was a more challenging AI rocking weapon combinations that seemed overpowered and impossible… because those weapon combinations were overpowered and impossible. FIxing it was thus a matter of making sure that the modifications could no longer fetch incorrect data for weapon stats.

Not really curious about why the bug was happening, but still in the mood to shoot at other spacecraft? Perhaps you’d prefer to watch a video (by longtime MOP backer Phoenix Dfire) on Assassinations missions in 2.1, which can be found just below. It’s as good a place as any to see the new AI in action without its weapons of madness.
