The authority said the company lacks a legal basis justifying "the mass collection and storage of personal data ... to 'train' the algorithms" of ChatGPT. The company also processes data inaccurately, it added.

ChatGPT also suffered a data breach and exposed users conversations and payment information of its users last week, the Italian authority said. It added OpenAI does not verify the age of users and exposes "minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to the their degree of development and self-awareness."

OpenAI doesn't have an office in the EU, but its representative in the European Economic Area has 20 days to communicate how it plans on bringing ChatGPT into compliance with EU privacy rules or face a penalty of up to 4 percent of its global revenue.

OpenAI disabled access to ChatGPT in Italy following the Italian regulator's order, but a spokesperson said the company disagreed with the findings. "We believe we comply with GDPR and other privacy laws," said the spokesperson in a written response to POLITICO.

The CEO of the company, Sam Altman, said on Twitter that OpenAI was deferring to "the Italian government" on the issue. "Italy is one of my favorite countries and I look forward to visiting again soon," he added.
