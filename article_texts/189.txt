The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been questioned by MPs over its use of a secret set of instructions that are used by its computers to identify potential benefit fraudsters, and which appear to disproportionately target disabled people.

Two of the department’s most senior officials were quizzed yesterday (Wednesday) about the secret algorithm being used by DWP.

Earlier this week, Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP) announced that it had sent a legal letter to DWP to demand details of how the algorithm works, and requesting proof that it does not target any particular group.

It believes that disabled people are being unfairly and wrongly targeted by DWP for lengthy and stressful fraud investigations.

Labour MP Debbie Abrahams asked the two DWP officials, permanent secretary Peter Schofield and director general for change Neil Couling, about the algorithm when they appeared before the Commons work and pensions committee yesterday.

She pointed to a 2019 United Nations report (PDF) which warned of the risks of a “digital welfare dystopia” and, she said, concluded that the use of such algorithms in social security systems have “inherently built-in biases that are discriminatory”.

Abrahams, whose Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency is in Greater Manchester, said that some of the cases she had heard about through GMCDP of disabled people being targeted by DWP for fraud investigations were “very concerning”.

Schofield did not deny that DWP used an algorithm, but he insisted that any decision on action being taken by DWP “always comes down to an individual”.

He said: “The automation can help us guide our work but ultimately it’s a decision made by individuals.”

Couling (pictured) claimed that it “was not an algorithm in the way that people might understand an algorithm”, and he insisted that what DWP was doing was “data matching”.

He said: “What we’re doing is matching data sets to see whether there’s consistency or not in what’s being reported.”

He said it was “not a machine telling us what to do and making decisions on benefit cases.

“It is data matching that is identifying questions to be answered and then we put those questions to the claimants themselves and give them the right to say, well, what is going on here.”

Couling told Abrahams that he did not know what proportion of those claimants being investigated for fraud were disabled people.

But he added: “I don’t know the answer to that but given that a significant proportion of the benefit caseload are disabled you would expect to see some disabled people will come up in the data matching.”

Rick Burgess, from GMCDP, told Disability News Service after the meeting: “Data matching would imply some process that is operating as an algorithm, I suspect, so they are splitting hairs over terminology.

“As for a human decision-maker being involved, we are keen to find out about that, and are those decisions reflective of good judgment or simply nodding through machine-picked candidates.”

He said it was noticeable how Couling had not answered Abrahams’ question about the proportion of disabled people being investigated, as this was a “key” issue.

GMCDP has been working with campaign group Foxglove, which said this week: “This system seems to unfairly target disabled people for investigation but the DWP won’t reveal how it works, or what they’ve done – if anything – to make it unbiased.

“Once flagged, you are forced into a bureaucratic hamster wheel of endless call centre queues, frustrating discussions with unhelpful staff and long forms that ask the same questions over and over – seemingly designed to trip people up.

“This can last for up to a year.”

Burgess had told The Observer earlier this week: “We’re tired of the fear of the brown envelope and tired of being repeatedly forced by DWP officials just to justify who we are.

“It’s time for the DWP to come clean about how this algorithm works and explain why so many disabled people are flagged for investigation.”

Please consider making a voluntary financial contribution to support the work of DNS and allow it to continue producing independent, carefully-researched news stories that focus on the lives and rights of disabled people and their user-led organisations.

Please do not contribute if you cannot afford to do so, and please note that DNS is not a charity. It is run and owned by disabled journalist John Pring and has been from its launch in April 2009.

Thank you for anything you can do to support the work of DNS…. Campaigners say disabled people are being unfairly targeted and living in 'fear of the brown envelope' thanks to mysterious computer processes that the government has never fully explained

The Department for Work and Pensions is facing fresh legal action to reveal what “algorithms” it uses to flag claims of benefit fraud.

The Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People has sent a “letter before action” demanding ministers “come clean” about techniques it claims is throwing disabled claimants into crisis.

The campaign group says disabled people have had questions raised over their benefit claims through a phone call, e-mail or “brown envelope” in the post without knowing why.

Sometimes they have essential cash “cut off” at the beginning of probes that can last over a year, the group said.

GMCDP spokesperson Rick Burgess said benefit claimants of all stripes are singled out, but campaigners believe the algorithm is “over-picking disabled people for investigations of fraud”.

He told a meeting tonight: “You have no idea how it came about that you’re being investigated - none whatsoever.

“It’s extremely upsetting when people get this.”

He added: “We are living in a shadow penal system that treats us like criminals for having to meet the same needs as everyone else. The fear of the brown envelope makes disabled people feel terrorised, in a constant state of anxiety and on edge.”

It is the second legal letter sent by the same group on the subject, with the first going out before Christmas.

The DWP responded in December, but the group alleges the government has still not answered key questions about what technology it uses to flag possible fraud.

The fresh legal letter - to which the DWP must respond in 28 days - challenges the “use of AI, algorithmic technology and other forms of automation” in investigation of benefit fraud.

It says the DWP uses “data matching” and “machine learning”, but other techniques may be being used and the DWP is not being clear about what they are.

The letter says there is a “risk of bias” to automated processing.

It demands the DWP set out “detailed information” on its use of computer processes and sets up “adequate safeguards”.

Barrister Will Perry, who is representing the legal action supported by the “tech justice” group Foxglove and Privacy International, said: “We know there is a data matching algorithm being used.

“The DWP seem to be experimenting with a wide range of different technologies.”

DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield has previously insisted computer systems “guide our work” but “we do not take any action against anyone based on a machine.”

He added: “It always comes down to an individual.”

Universal Credit director-general Neil Couling said last year: “It is not an algorithm in the way in which I think people may understand an algorithm.

“All we are doing is data matching,… We take what the RTI [earnings] data tells us, and whether a person has reported earnings to us.”

A spokesman for the DWP said: "“The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People in due course.”
