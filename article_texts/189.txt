Campaigners say disabled people are being unfairly targeted and living in 'fear of the brown envelope' thanks to mysterious computer processes that the government has never fully explained

The Department for Work and Pensions is facing fresh legal action to reveal what “algorithms” it uses to flag claims of benefit fraud.

The Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People has sent a “letter before action” demanding ministers “come clean” about techniques it claims is throwing disabled claimants into crisis.

The campaign group says disabled people have had questions raised over their benefit claims through a phone call, e-mail or “brown envelope” in the post without knowing why.

Sometimes they have essential cash “cut off” at the beginning of probes that can last over a year, the group said.

GMCDP spokesperson Rick Burgess said benefit claimants of all stripes are singled out, but campaigners believe the algorithm is “over-picking disabled people for investigations of fraud”.

He told a meeting tonight: “You have no idea how it came about that you’re being investigated - none whatsoever.

“It’s extremely upsetting when people get this.”

He added: “We are living in a shadow penal system that treats us like criminals for having to meet the same needs as everyone else. The fear of the brown envelope makes disabled people feel terrorised, in a constant state of anxiety and on edge.”

It is the second legal letter sent by the same group on the subject, with the first going out before Christmas.

The DWP responded in December, but the group alleges the government has still not answered key questions about what technology it uses to flag possible fraud.

The fresh legal letter - to which the DWP must respond in 28 days - challenges the “use of AI, algorithmic technology and other forms of automation” in investigation of benefit fraud.

It says the DWP uses “data matching” and “machine learning”, but other techniques may be being used and the DWP is not being clear about what they are.

The letter says there is a “risk of bias” to automated processing.

It demands the DWP set out “detailed information” on its use of computer processes and sets up “adequate safeguards”.

Barrister Will Perry, who is representing the legal action supported by the “tech justice” group Foxglove and Privacy International, said: “We know there is a data matching algorithm being used.

“The DWP seem to be experimenting with a wide range of different technologies.”

DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield has previously insisted computer systems “guide our work” but “we do not take any action against anyone based on a machine.”

He added: “It always comes down to an individual.”

Universal Credit director-general Neil Couling said last year: “It is not an algorithm in the way in which I think people may understand an algorithm.

“All we are doing is data matching,… We take what the RTI [earnings] data tells us, and whether a person has reported earnings to us.”

A spokesman for the DWP said: "“The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People in due course.”. Disabled people are being subjected to stressful checks and months of frustrating bureaucracy after being identified as potential benefit fraudsters by an algorithm the government is refusing to disclose, according to a new legal challenge.

A group in Manchester has launched the action after mounting testimony from disabled people in the area that they were being disproportionately targeted for benefit fraud investigations. Some said they were living in “fear of the brown envelope” showing their case was being investigated. Others said they had received a phone call, without explanation as to why they had been flagged.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has previously conceded that it uses “cutting-edge artificial intelligence” to track possible fraud but has so far rebuffed attempts to explain how the algorithm behind the system was compiled. Campaigners say that once flagged, those being examined can face an invasive and humiliating investigation lasting up to a year.

A legal letter has been sent to the DWP demanding details of the automated process that triggers the investigations. Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), which sent the letter with the help of campaign group Foxglove, said a “huge percentage” of the group has been affected by the system. The group believes the government has a legal duty to be transparent about how the algorithm works.

Concerns were raised by the charity Privacy International, which first found references in a DWP report to its use of “cutting-edge artificial intelligence to crack down on organised criminal gangs committing large-scale benefit fraud”. A 2019 UN report into the “digital welfare state” said algorithms were “highly likely” to repeat biases reflected in existing data and make them even worse. It added: “Inbuilt forms of discrimination can fatally undermine the right to social protection for key groups and individuals.”

The government has until Friday to respond to the legal letter.

“We’re tired of the fear of the brown envelope and tired of being repeatedly forced by DWP officials just to justify who we are,” said Rick Burgess of the GMCDP. “It’s time for the DWP to come clean about how this algorithm works and explain why so many disabled people are flagged for investigation. Disabled people need support – not being ground down by a brutal system that assumes we are fraudulent until proven innocent.”

Foxglove said: “The DWP algorithm seems to send poor and disabled people to the call centre from hell. The DWP needs to explain exactly how its algorithm works and what is done to eliminate bias – or be taken to court.”

Officials stressed that specialist staff were involved in any cases of suspected fraud and error and support was offered to those who needed it. A DWP spokesperson said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the GMCDP in due course.”. Disabled campaigners have sent a legal letter to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to question how its use of a secret algorithm* could be discriminating against disabled people in the way it selects claimants to face benefit fraud investigations.

Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP), which is being supported by the tech justice campaign group Foxglove, believes the algorithm is “over-picking” disabled people for its benefit fraud investigations.

It has now sent a formal letter to DWP to ask for information about how the algorithm is being used and for evidence that it does not discriminate against disabled people, and to warn of potential further legal action.

So far, DWP is refusing to say how people are being targeted, how it is ensuring disabled people’s rights are protected, and what checks and balances are in place to ensure benefit claimants are not being unfairly and unlawfully harassed.

Rick Burgess (pictured), from GMCDP, told an online event last week that algorithms “tend to reproduce the biases and discriminations in wider society and culture”.

He said GMCDP and Foxglove suspect that DWP’s algorithm is “over-picking disabled people for investigations of fraud”, resulting in extreme distress for the claimants who have been picked.

Burgess said this distress can be particularly severe if the claimant already experiences paranoia or anxiety.

He said: “It can be extremely debilitating. I know people have withdrawn from life because of it. I know there have been suicides because of it. It is extremely harmful to people.

“For those investigations to occur I think there needs to be an extremely high level of proof and suspicion before you can even start that process, because the risk to people is potentially lethal.”

He said the use of the algorithm by DWP had become a new barrier for disabled people.

He said: “Disabled people are consistently always having to be tested, always having to prove ourselves, always having to fill in forms, always having to pass tests, you’re always being questioned about your identity.”

GMCDP has started a crowdfunder to raise money for any legal costs it might face in the case against DWP, and is nearly halfway to its target of £15,000.

Burgess said the way fraud investigations are carried out by DWP is “absolutely, classically Kafkaesque”.

He said: “You don’t know who your accuser is. You don’t know why you’ve suddenly been picked out.

“Typically, it’s either an envelope, a phone call, or email. It’s extremely upsetting when people get this.”

He said that the “weird pattern” of disabled people being suddenly investigated for no apparent reason suggested a system that was “kind of making up its own rules”.

He added: “In an investigation, before anything has been proven, your benefits can be stopped so you are treated as guilty until proven innocent.”

Burgess said the idea that disability benefit fraud was widespread was a “masterpiece of propaganda” as the actual fraud rate for some disability benefits was as low as 0.5 per cent**, but DWP “still treat everybody as a suspect”.

Laura Lazaro Cabrera, a legal officer with Privacy International, which campaigns against companies and governments exploiting data technology, said they originally uncovered evidence of the use of algorithms in 2019 in a DWP anti-fraud staff training manual and in DWP’s annual report and accounts for 2017-18.

The annual report said DWP was developing “cutting-edge artificial intelligence to crack down on organised criminal gangs committing large-scale benefit fraud”.

DWP later admitted to using “data matching and data analysis to help identify people who may not have declared their circumstances correctly”.

But it has so far refused to release any information about its use of algorithms to Privacy International, arguing that to do so would “prejudice the prevention and detection of fraud and crime”.

Will Perry, a barrister with Monckton Chambers, who is working on the GMCDP legal case, said DWP appeared to be “experimenting with a wide range of different technologies”.

He said the case focused on DWP’s lack of transparency, and was arguing potential breaches of rights under the European Convention on Human Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as DWP’s obligations under the Equality Act’s public sector equality duty.

He said they expected a formal response to their legal letter next month, but he warned that it was “uncharted territory” for lawyers as the few previous UK cases have been settled before reaching court.

Rosa Curling, director of Foxglove, said they were hoping the legal action would show that algorithms such as those being used by DWP could be challenged in court, and that it would encourage other groups to consider taking action through the courts.

She said algorithms appear to be being used secretly across local and national government, “without proper scrutiny and accountability, and… are making decisions that are affecting everybody’s lives in an absolutely profound way”.

A DWP spokesperson said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People in due course.”

Thank you for anything you can do to support the work of DNS…. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been questioned by MPs over its use of a secret set of instructions that are used by its computers to identify potential benefit fraudsters, and which appear to disproportionately target disabled people.

Two of the department’s most senior officials were quizzed yesterday (Wednesday) about the secret algorithm being used by DWP.

Earlier this week, Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People (GMCDP) announced that it had sent a legal letter to DWP to demand details of how the algorithm works, and requesting proof that it does not target any particular group.

It believes that disabled people are being unfairly and wrongly targeted by DWP for lengthy and stressful fraud investigations.

Labour MP Debbie Abrahams asked the two DWP officials, permanent secretary Peter Schofield and director general for change Neil Couling, about the algorithm when they appeared before the Commons work and pensions committee yesterday.

She pointed to a 2019 United Nations report (PDF) which warned of the risks of a “digital welfare dystopia” and, she said, concluded that the use of such algorithms in social security systems have “inherently built-in biases that are discriminatory”.

Abrahams, whose Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency is in Greater Manchester, said that some of the cases she had heard about through GMCDP of disabled people being targeted by DWP for fraud investigations were “very concerning”.

Schofield did not deny that DWP used an algorithm, but he insisted that any decision on action being taken by DWP “always comes down to an individual”.

He said: “The automation can help us guide our work but ultimately it’s a decision made by individuals.”

Couling (pictured) claimed that it “was not an algorithm in the way that people might understand an algorithm”, and he insisted that what DWP was doing was “data matching”.

He said: “What we’re doing is matching data sets to see whether there’s consistency or not in what’s being reported.”

He said it was “not a machine telling us what to do and making decisions on benefit cases.

“It is data matching that is identifying questions to be answered and then we put those questions to the claimants themselves and give them the right to say, well, what is going on here.”

Couling told Abrahams that he did not know what proportion of those claimants being investigated for fraud were disabled people.

But he added: “I don’t know the answer to that but given that a significant proportion of the benefit caseload are disabled you would expect to see some disabled people will come up in the data matching.”

Rick Burgess, from GMCDP, told Disability News Service after the meeting: “Data matching would imply some process that is operating as an algorithm, I suspect, so they are splitting hairs over terminology.

“As for a human decision-maker being involved, we are keen to find out about that, and are those decisions reflective of good judgment or simply nodding through machine-picked candidates.”

He said it was noticeable how Couling had not answered Abrahams’ question about the proportion of disabled people being investigated, as this was a “key” issue.

GMCDP has been working with campaign group Foxglove, which said this week: “This system seems to unfairly target disabled people for investigation but the DWP won’t reveal how it works, or what they’ve done – if anything – to make it unbiased.

“Once flagged, you are forced into a bureaucratic hamster wheel of endless call centre queues, frustrating discussions with unhelpful staff and long forms that ask the same questions over and over – seemingly designed to trip people up.

“This can last for up to a year.”

Burgess had told The Observer earlier this week: “We’re tired of the fear of the brown envelope and tired of being repeatedly forced by DWP officials just to justify who we are.

“It’s time for the DWP to come clean about how this algorithm works and explain why so many disabled people are flagged for investigation.”
