Remote-learning software, like most software, can be biased. Nonprofit, Mozilla Foundation, approached us to bring to life the story of Amaya, a student who used a test proctoring app to take her lab quiz. The testing recognition software failed to recognize her on-screen presence because of her skin tone. Our mission was to share her story and raise awareness of what many students of colour face when dealing with testing recognition software used for tests and classes. We chose a 3-D approach with a limited palette to create a visually striking piece, while the friendly character design elevates the viewers’ empathy for Amaya. The animated spot was used throughout Mozilla’s social media channels to help encourage the next generation of programmers to be aware of hidden biases in their work.
