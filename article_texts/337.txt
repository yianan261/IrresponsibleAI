Tesla has released more details about the fatal crash in Texas that has captivated the media over the last week.

While Tesla released more information following an investigation with local authorities, ther are still a lot of questions unanswered.

On April 17, a strange and tragic accident in a Tesla that happened in Spring, Texas near Houston.

A Tesla Model S missed a turn, hit a tree and caught on fire – leaving the two people inside dead. The owner of the Model S, a local doctor, and his friend.

The accident made national news and it was reported that as a “driverless Tesla crash” because the police said that they believe no one was driving the vehicle.

That statement was reportedly based on the bodies being found in the front passenger seat and the backseat as well as a comment from a family member about the driver possibly jumping into the backseat.

Tesla doesn’t have autonomous vehicles on the road where drivers can jump in the backseat, but many speculated that Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assist features might have been involved.

CEO Elon Musk quickly commented that data showed Autopilot wasn’t engaged and couldn’t have been engaged on the road where the accident happened and criticized the media for suggesting that it might have been the case.

The NTSB and NHTSA both launched investigations into the accident.

Now Tesla has commented in more detail than Musk’s short tweet from last week.

During a conference call for Tesla’s Q1 2021 results, Lars Moravy, Tesla’s Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, commented:

“We did a study with the authorities within the past week to understand what happened in that particular crash and what we have learned from that is Autosteer did not and could not engage on the road conditions as it was designed and adaptive cruise control only engaged when the driver was buckled and driving above 5 mph, and it only accelerated to 30 mph within the distance before the car crash.” As well, the car’s adaptive cruise control decelerated and came to a stop after the driver’s seatbelt was unbuckled.Through further investigation of the vehicle accident remains with NTSB and local police and we were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed leading to the likelihood that someone was indeed in the driver’s seat and all seatbelts post-crash were unbuckled.

The Tesla executive also confirmed that Tesla couldn’t retrieve the SD card with more data or video of the crash.

The authorities are still working on that and the investigations are ongoing.

Electrek’s Take

Alright, this is a much better response from Tesla than what Elon said, but it is still confusing.

First of all, Autopilot was involved in that drive (not the crash apparently). Maybe not Autosteer, but Tesla has advertised TACC, its traffic-aware cruise control, as an Autopilot feature.

Now it doesn’t mean it was involved in the crash, but it does explain a few things.

It looks like the driver did try to engage Autopilot with adaptive cruise control, but only cruise control could come up and then he unbuckled his seatbelt – presumably to jump on the backseat as stated by a family member.

Therefore, it looks like the theory that they went on a drive to “test out autonomous features” is a real possibility even though Tesla’s Autopilot features shouldn’t be described as “autonomous driving” and it looks like the Autopilot driver-assist features were misused.

Now it looks like the driver might have misunderstood the capability of Tesla’s Autopilot features since it looks like they worked as intended but were misused if he tried to jump in the backseat.

If TACC indeed came to a stop as described by Moravy, then we still don’t know what happened after and leading to the actual crash.

We are still far from a clear picture of what happened that night despite the whole event apparently being only a very short drive and hope the NTSB and NHTSA investigation shed more light on this tragic and strange accident.

As for Elon’s comment about the media, there sure was some misreporting regarding this event, but a lot of that came from the police stating that they believed no one was in the driver’s seat.

There were some speculations in the media that wasn’t smart, but it’s not wrong for the media to report what the police were saying about the crash. As long as they share the new information as it comes in, I don’t think we can blame them much on that front.

Now I’m not talking about the few media, like Automotive News for example, who straight put the blame of Autopilot. That’s obviously bad reporting.

It felt to me that a lot of the misreporting came from misunderstanding Autopilot in the media. A PR department would certainly help on that front.. A Tesla Model S that crashed and caught fire recently in Texas, killing two men, may have had someone in the driver’s seat, according to Tesla’s top executives. Their comments in an earnings call Monday contradict statements made by local law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of the crash, and could complicate the efforts by federal crash investigators who are also examining the incident.

Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, said that company representatives were able to inspect the crash, along with local law enforcement and investigators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Moravy said the company was able to determine that the steering wheel was “deformed,” leading them to conclude there was someone in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash.

“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled”

“All seatbelts post-crash were found to be unbuckled,” Moravy added. Tesla’s advanced driver assist system, Autopilot, can only operate when the seatbelts are buckled. (Consumer Reports recently was able to prove that Tesla’s vehicles can easily “tricked” into thinking a person is in the driver’s seat.)

If the government is upset with Tesla’s disclosures, it isn’t saying so. A spokesperson for the NHTSA declined to comment, while a representative for the NTSB did not respond to a request for comment.

Moravy said that Tesla was unable to recover the SD card from the vehicle, but that local law enforcement was working on getting that to the company. “We continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future, through this kind of data and other information from the field,” he added.

The crash took place on Saturday, April 17th, in Spring, Texas. According to KHOU in Houston, investigators at the scene were “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, according to The New York Times. The two victims were identified as Everette Talbot, 69, and William Varner, 59, a prominent local anesthesiologist.

In the aftermath of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicate that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. Today, the company took its comments a step further, directly contradicting law enforcement’s initial assessment of the incident.

It is not, however, the first time that Tesla has made public statements about a crash under investigation by the federal government. Musk has also been highly critical of media coverage about incidents involving Tesla vehicles, saying journalists are unfairly focusing on his company for sensationalist reasons and questioning why the numerous standard road deaths that occur every day are not covered as vigorously. (For a good counter argument, please read Jalopnik journalist Jason Torchinsky’s explanation about why Tesla crashes are newsworthy.)

In the call on Monday, Musk reiterated his critique of “deceptive media practices,” claiming that Autopilot was not in use at the time of the Texas crash, and slamming journalists for saying otherwise.. Tesla CEO Elon Musk doubled down Monday on his previous claim that the electric vehicle's Autopilot feature did not play a role in a fatal crash in Texas earlier this month that killed two people.

Musk reiterated his criticism of media reports surrounding the crash during the company's first-quarter earnings call, labeling the stories as "extremely deceptive" and "totally false." He added that any journalists suggesting that Autopilot played a role should be "ashamed of themselves."

TESLA'S ELON MUSK CITES ‘REALLY SEVERE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES’ YET STILL POSTS RECORD DELIVERIES

Lars Moravy, Tesla vice president of vehicle engineering, told analysts on the earnings call that representatives from the company were able to inspect the crash along with local law enforcement and federal investigators from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

"What we've learned from that effort was that autosteer did not and could not engage on the road condition as it was designed," Moravy said. "Our adaptive cruise control only engaged when the driver was buckled and above five miles per hour and it only accelerated to 30 miles per hour over the distance before the car crashed. Adaptive cruise control disengaged the car slowly to complete the stop when the driver's seat belt was unbuckled."

Further investigation of the vehicle and the accident found that the steering wheel was "deformed," which Moravy said points to "the likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash." He added that all seat belts post-crash were found to be unbuckled.

Tesla said it has so far been unable to recover data from the vehicle's SD card at the time of impact. Tesla models allow for these secure digital memory cards to use the cameras installed in the car to continuously record what is happening on the road while driving, as well as space around the vehicle when Sentry Mode is activated.

"Local authorities are working on doing that and we await their report," Moravy added. "We continue to hold safety in a high regard and look to improve our products in the future through this kind of data and other information from the field."

Tesla's claim contradicts previous comments made by Mark Herman, constable for Harris County Precinct 4.

Herman told KHOU, the CBS affiliated TV station in Houston, that police "are 100 percent certain that no one was in the driver’s seat," noting the two victims were found in the passenger and back seat.

According to the New York Times, Herman also said that minutes before the crash, the wives of the two men watched them leave in the Tesla after the husbands said they wanted to go for a drive and were talking about the vehicle’s Autopilot feature.

A test drive of a Tesla Model Y by Consumer Reports engineers found that Autopilot can still run regardless of whether a passenger is in the driver seat.

TESLA TEST DRIVE SHOWS AUTOPILOT WILL RUN WITHOUT PASSENGER BEHIND THE WHEEL

Earlier this month, Tesla released its accident data for the first quarter of 2021. Musk claimed that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot engaged are now approaching a 10 times lower chance of an accident than the average vehicle.

In the first quarter of 2021, the company registered one accident for every 4.19 million miles driven with Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with the Tesla's active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. As for those driving without Autopilot or active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 978,000 miles driven.

In comparison, the most recent data from the National Highway Transportation Security Administration finds that there is an automobile crash in the United States every 484,000 miles.

Tesla warns consumers that while its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability features are designed to become more capable over time, they do not make the vehicle autonomous, and are intended for use with a fully attentive drive who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.

Tesla noted in its earnings release that it is working on developing a "vision-only system," which it claims is "ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy."

"Our AI-based software architecture has been increasingly reliant on cameras, to the point where radar is becoming unnecessary earlier than expected," the company wrote. As a result, the company said its Full Self Driving (FSD) team "is fully focused on evolving to a vision-based autonomous system and we are nearly ready to switch the US market to Tesla Vision."

Musk said on the earnings call that removing the vehicle's radar system is "finally getting rid of one of the last crutches" to completing its autonomous driving system, which will utilize eight cameras.

"Radar was really, it was making up for some of the shortfalls of vision but this is not good. You actually just need vision to work," Musk said. "When vision works, it works better than the best human. It's like having eyes in the back your head, the side of your head and has three eyes of different focal distances looking forward and processing it at a speed that is superhuman."

Musk believes Tesla's self-driving car technology will help create a car that is "dramatically safer" than the average vehicle.

Despite the safety concerns and "really severe supply chain issues," Tesla hit a new record of 184,877 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter.

The company also reported record net income of $438 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with $16 million, or 2 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 93 cents per share. Total revenue grew 74% year-over-year to $10.3 billion, with about $518 million in automotive revenue coming from sales of regulatory credits. Both top and bottom line exceeded analyst estimates.

Tesla expects the first deliveries of its latest Model S to begin "very shortly" and noted that Model Y production in Shanghai and Fremont, California continues to ramp up. The company also noted that its making progress on its two new factories in Berlin and Texas, which remain on track to start vehicle production and deliveries later this year. Tesla Semi deliveries will also begin in 2021.

Looking ahead, the company expects 50% average growth in vehicle deliveries in 2021 and beyond.

Tesla stock fell as much as 3% in after-hours trading following company's earnings announcement.. A crash involving a Tesla Model S left two people dead Sunday after the car collided with a tree and caught fire, according to local NBC News affiliate KPRC 2 in Spring, Texas. Authorities say an investigation into the crash is ongoing, though the consensus so far is neither of the two men involved in the crash were driving the Model S at the time of impact. On Monday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke out on Twitter to refute initial findings from the early investigation, as two federal agencies examine the wreck.

First responders found one of the men in the front passenger seat and discovered the second in the back seat. The seating arrangement points to Tesla's Autopilot or Full Self-Driving mode beta being enabled, though this wasn't explicitly mentioned in the initial report. Musk tweeted that standard Autopilot "would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have."

"Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled and this car did not purchase FSD," he added.

Neither Autopilot nor the Full Self-Driving driver-assist systems are fully autonomous and both are considered Level 2 systems on the SAE scale of autonomy. A Tesla is not capable of handling driving on its own, despite the "Full Self-Driving" name. According to tweets from a local reporter, embedded above, the car failed to navigate a curve in the road and hit a tree before bursting into flames, with no driver behind the wheel to regain control.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed on Monday it deployed a Special Crash Investigation Team to the incident. An agency spokesperson told Roadshow, "We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information." Local police also demanded any crash data from Tesla.

Highlighting the need for fire safety in the budding EV era, local crews needed to contact Tesla to understand how to put the fire out. Firefighters used 32,000 gallons of water to get the blaze under control, according to KPRC 2.

Tesla does not operate a public relations department to field requests for comment.
