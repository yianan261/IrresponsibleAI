'SUE FOR RACISM' Outrage as Asian man’s photo is rejected by New Zealand government’s passport software because it claimed his ‘eyes were closed’

AN Asian man’s passport photo was rejected by the New Zealand government after its facial recognition software claimed his “eyes were closed”.

Richard Lee, who is originally from Taiwan, shared a screenshot of the awkward error message on Facebook, prompting dozens to slam the technology as “racist”.

The DJ, who grew up in New Zealand and has since moved to Australia, wanted to renew his passport so he could go home for Christmas.

But he was shocked when his snap was rejected, with a message popping up which read: “The photo you want to upload does not meet our criteria because: Subject eyes are closed”.

He told news.com.au he tried a few different pictures with “no luck” – despite his eyes being open in all the shots.

“So I rang up the passport office and they told me there was shadowing in my eyes and also uneven lighting on the face, which makes it hard for the software to process,” he said.

The 22-year-old, also known as DJ Richy Fancy, finally got one accepted after taking new passport photos at an Australia Post office.

Richard insisted he did not think the computer glitch was “racist”, but others on social media were not so sure.

After reading the pop-up message from the Department of Internal Affairs, one Facebook user wrote: “Racist much?”

“Technology is getting racist,” another user commented.

Another Facebook user wrote: "Sue for racism."

Richard then jokingly shared another shot on Facebook using a Snapchat filter which gave him huge cartoon eyes.

"I hope they accept this one. Wish me luck," he captioned the picture.

The New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs said the software was “one of the most technologically advanced in the world”.

“Up to 20 per cent of photos submitted online are rejected for a large variety of reasons,” a department spokesman said.

“The first photos in this case contained uneven lighting on the individual’s face but a later one was accepted the same day.

“The most common error is a subject’s eyes being closed and that was the generic error message sent in that case.”

The spokesman said the department had confidence in the technology and did not believe they discriminated against any specific individuals.. CNN —

It’s a common annoyance, you’re filling out a form online and you get some error.

New Zealander Richard Lee was applying for a passport online when the system objected to the image he uploaded.

“The photo you want to upload does not meet our criteria because: subject eyes are closed,” it said.

But Lee, who is of Asian descent, had his eyes open.

“I fell off my chair laughing,” he told CNN. “Like, I know I have small eyes and I have no problem with it. But the fact that a computer can notice as well, that’s just hilarious.”

After trying three more images, he phoned the passport office to ask for help.

“They said it was the shadow in my eyes and the uneven lighting on the face makes it hard for the software to process,” he said.

A New Zealand Department of Internal Affairs spokesman denied their system discriminated against “any specific set of individuals.”

He added that up to 20% of photos submitted online are rejected for a variety of reasons – most commonly shadows on the face which the software interprets as closed eyes.

“That was the generic error message sent in this case,” Internal Affairs spokesman Steve Corbett said. “We… note that in this case another photo was submitted on the same day and the individual was issued a New Zealand passport.”

Passport problems

Lee – currently attending university in Melbourne, Australia – eventually gave up and went to a local post office to get some passport photos taken.

“Fortunately one of those worked,” he said.

This wouldn’t be the first time an automated system has had problem with non-white faces.

In 2010, Taiwanese-American blogger Joz Wang was shocked when her digital camera kept asking “did someone blink?” on photos of her, while a year before black users complained of HP webcams not being able to detect their faces.

“(I’m) actually quite impressed that in the past 80 years we’ve gone from Turing machines to this software that can read a human face,” Lee said.

Some faces, at least.. ADVERTISEMENT

Look at this picture of 22-year-old Richard Lee. Do his eyes look open to you? Of course they do. But that didn’t stop an automated online system from rejecting his passport renewal because, according to the facial recognition software, his eyes were deemed to be closed.

“The photo you want to upload does not meet our criteria because: subject eyes are closed,” reads the form that Richard recently posted on Facebook. The online passport checker is run by New Zealand’s department for Internal Affairs, but it clearly needs a little recalibrating in order to recognize people of different ethnicities. Fortunately the engineering student found the funny side, and his passport was renewed after a later photograph was accepted.
