A popular training dataset for AI image generation contained links to child abuse imagery, Stanford’s Internet Observatory found, potentially allowing AI models to create harmful content.

LAION-5B, a dataset used by Stable Diffusion creator Stability AI, included at least 1,679 illegal images scraped from social media posts and popular adult websites.

The researchers began combing through the LAION dataset in September 2023 to investigate how much, if any, child sexual abuse material (CSAM) was present. They looked through hashes or the image’s identifiers. These were sent to CSAM detection platforms like PhotoDNA and verified by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection.

The dataset does not keep repositories of the images, according to the LAION website. It indexes the internet and contains links to images and alt text that it scrapes. Google’s initial version of the Imagen text-to-image AI tool, released only for research, trained on a different variant of LAION’s datasets called LAION-400M, an older version of 5B. The company said subsequent iterations did not use LAION datasets. The Stanford report noted Imagen’s developers found 400M included “a wide range of inappropriate content including pornographic imagery, racist slurs, and harmful social stereotypes.”

LAION, the nonprofit that manages the dataset, told Bloomberg it has a “zero-tolerance” policy for harmful content and would temporarily remove the datasets online. Stability AI told the publication that it has guidelines against the misuse of its platforms. The company said that while it trained its models with LAION-5B, it focused on a portion of the dataset and fine-tuned it for safety.

Stanford’s researchers said the presence of CSAM does not necessarily influence the output of models trained on the dataset. Still, there’s always the possibility the model learned something from the images.

“The presence of repeated identical instances of CSAM is also problematic, particularly due to its reinforcement of images of specific victims,” the report said.

The researchers acknowledged it would be difficult to fully remove the problematic content, especially from the AI models trained on it. They recommended that models trained on LAION-5B, such as Stable Diffusion 1.5, “should be deprecated and distribution ceased where feasible.” Google released a new version of Imagen but has not made public which dataset it trained on aside from not using LAION.

US attorneys general have called on Congress to set up a committee to investigate the impact of AI on child exploitation and prohibit the creation of AI-generated CSAM.. The integrity of a major AI image training dataset, LAION-5B, utilized by influential AI models like Stable Diffusion, has been compromised after the discovery of thousands of links to Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). This revelation has triggered concerns about the potential ramifications of such content infiltrating the AI ecosystem.

The Unveiling of Disturbing Content

Stanford Internet Observatory researchers are the ones who uncovered the unsettling truth behind the LAION-5B dataset. They revealed that the dataset contained over 3,000 suspected instances of CSAM. This extensive dataset, integral to the AI ecosystem, faced removal following the shocking discovery made by the Stanford team.

LAION-5B’s Temporary Removal

LAION is a non-profit organization responsible for creating open-source tools for machine learning. In response to the findings, the organization decided to temporarily take down its datasets, including LAION-5B and another named LAION-400M. The organization expressed a commitment to ensuring the safety of its datasets before republishing them.

The Methodology Behind the Discovery

The Stanford researchers employed a combination of perceptual and cryptographic hash-based detection methods to identify instances of suspected CSAM in the LAION-5B dataset. Their study raised concerns about the indiscriminate scraping of the internet for AI training purposes. It further emphasized the dangers associated with such practices.

The Ripple Effect on AI Companies

Major generative AI companies, including Stable Diffusion, relied on LAION-5B for training their models. The Stanford paper highlighted the potential influence of CSAM on AI model outputs and the reinforcement of harmful images within the dataset. The repercussions extended to other models, such as Google’s Imagen, which found inappropriate content in LAION’s datasets during an audit.

Our Say

The revelations about the inclusion of Child Sexual Abuse Material in the LAION-5B dataset underscore the need for responsible practices in the development and utilization of AI training datasets. The incident raises questions about the efficacy of existing filtering mechanisms and the responsibility of organizations to consult with experts in ensuring the safety and legality of their datasets. As the AI community grapples with these challenges, a comprehensive reevaluation of dataset creation processes is imperative to prevent the inadvertent perpetuation of illegal and harmful content through AI models.. A Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) investigation identified hundreds of known images of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in an open dataset used to train popular AI text-to-image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion.

A previous SIO report with the nonprofit online child safety group Thorn found rapid advances in generative machine learning make it possible to create realistic imagery that facilitates child sexual exploitation using open source AI image generation models. Our new investigation reveals that these models are trained directly on CSAM present in a public dataset of billions of images, known as LAION-5B. The dataset included known CSAM scraped from a wide array of sources, including mainstream social media websites and popular adult video sites.

Removal of the identified source material is currently in progress as researchers reported the image URLs to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the U.S. and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P). The study was primarily conducted using hashing tools such as PhotoDNA, which match a fingerprint of an image to databases maintained by nonprofits that receive and process reports of online child sexual exploitation and abuse. Researchers did not view abuse content, and matches were reported to NCMEC and confirmed by C3P where possible.

There are methods to minimize CSAM in datasets used to train AI models, but it is challenging to clean or stop the distribution of open datasets with no central authority that hosts the actual data. The report outlines safety recommendations for collecting datasets, training models and hosting models trained on scraped datasets. Images collected in future datasets should be checked against known lists of CSAM by using detection tools such as Microsoft’s PhotoDNA or partnering with child safety organizations such as NCMEC and C3P.. A widely-used artificial intelligence data set used to train Stable Diffusion, Imagen and other AI image generator models has been removed by its creator after a study found it contained thousands of instances of suspected child sexual abuse material.

LAION — also known as Large-scale Artificial Intelligence Open Network, is a German nonprofit organization that makes open-sourced artificial intelligence models and data sets used to train several popular text-to-image models.

A Dec. 20 report from researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory’s Cyber Policy Center said they identified 3,226 instances of suspected CSAM — or child sexual abuse material — in the LAION-5B data set, "much of which was confirmed as CSAM by third parties,” according to Stanford Cyber Policy Center's Big Data Architect and Chief Technologist David Thiel.

Thiel noted that while the presence of CSAM doesn’t necessarily mean it will “drastically” influence the output of models trained on the data set, it could still have some effect.

“While the amount of CSAM present does not necessarily indicate that the presence of CSAM drastically influences the output of the model above and beyond the model’s ability to combine the concepts of sexual activity and children, it likely does still exert influence," said Thiel.

“The presence of repeated identical instances of CSAM is also problematic, particularly due to its reinforcement of images of specific victims,” he added.

The LAION-5B dataset was released in March 2022 and includes 5.85 billion image-text pairs, according to LAION.

LAION has a zero tolerance policy for illegal content. We work with organizations like IWF and others to validate links in the LAION datasets with filtering tools developed by our community and partner organizations to ensure they are safe. https://t.co/SStsqukbFK — LAION (@laion_ai) December 20, 2023

In a statement, LAION said it has removed the data sets out of “an abundance of caution,” including both LAION-5B and its LAION-400M, “to ensure they are safe before republishing them.”
