ARTICLE TITLE: Tesla Model X on Autopilot Crashed into California Highway Barrier, Killing Driver
Tesla’s Autopilot is getting smarter. The semi-autonomous driving system, set to form the basis of CEO Elon Musk’s self-driving car ambitions, has been receiving regular software updates to improve the underlying artificial intelligence. The company’s vehicles running on the Hardware 2 system can now tackle some of the toughest corners on the road.

In a video shared by Electrek on Thursday, Tesla Model X owner Mike switches on Autopilot along a curve of Virginia highway near Chester. The Tesla Model S P100D loaner car that he’s using effortlessly guides its way through a tricky corner, where previously his car struggled to make the turn.

It’s a promising step for Tesla as it prepares to roll out autonomous driving. The Hardware 2 suite of cameras and sensors, which have shipped with every car since October 2016, are expected to power the new mode with just computer updates. Musk has suggested that coast-to-coast autonomy is achievable in the next six months.

Before that point, Tesla needs to get the existing Autopilot features moving past the Mobileye systems used in previous vehicles. In the Enhanced Autopilot feature set, Tesla promises advanced features like moving to the correct lane, a feature this video suggests is coming soon.

“Once on the freeway, your Tesla will determine which lane you need to be in and when,” the company says in its description of Enhanced Autopilot. “In addition to ensuring you reach your intended exit, Autopilot will watch for opportunities to move to a faster lane when you’re caught behind slower traffic. When you reach your exit, your Tesla will depart the freeway, slow down and transition control back to you.”

In a second video, Mike tried the curve again with his Model X at night. It sticks closer to the left side of the curve than right, but ultimately offers a far smoother ride than before:

“This is a huge improvement for the vehicle,” Mike says in the second video. “One of the best runs ever by this Model X.”

Perhaps autonomy this year isn’t so unfeasible after all.. Tesla has said a car that crashed in California last week, killing its driver, was operating on Autopilot.

The 23 March crash on highway 101 in Mountain View is the latest accident to involve self-driving technology. Earlier this month, a self-driving Volvo SUV that was being tested by the ride-hailing service Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.

Federal investigators are looking into the California crash, as well a crash in January of a Tesla Model S that may have been operating under the Autopilot system.



In a blogpost, Tesla said the driver of the sport-utility Model X that crashed in Mountain View, 38-year-old Apple software engineer Wei Huang, “had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.

“The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider … but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.”

Tesla also said the concrete highway divider had previously been damaged, increasing its impact on the car. The vehicle also caught fire, though Tesla said no one was in the vehicle when that happened.

The company said its Autopilot feature can keep speed, change lanes and self-park but requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, in order to be able to take control and avoid accidents.



Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, Tesla said, but it does make them less likely.



“No one knows about the accidents that didn’t happen,” Tesla said, “only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe.

“There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year.”



The company added that it “care[s] deeply for and feel[s] indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety.

“None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer’s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss.”
