ARTICLE TITLE: Waze Navigates Motorists into Wildfires
Out-of-control wildfires are raging in and near Los Angeles.

Mapping apps, which are frequently designed to help users route around traffic, are in some cases reportedly directing drivers into fire-affected zones.

The Los Angeles Police Department is warning those in the area to cease using such apps.



Southern California residents and visitors fleeing the wildfires raging around Los Angeles are contending with a new problem — mapping apps that are reportedly directing them towards areas that are on fire.

The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is warning area residents and visitors that apps that offer driving directions are sometimes suggesting routes through regions that are ablaze, The Los Angeles Times reported.

Apps such as Waze and Google Maps take traffic into account when calculating routes and will often suggest that drivers take roads that appear less busy. However, they apparently aren't calculating in the fact that those routes may be free because of the fire danger.

The LAPD is reportedly warning those in the area not to use any navigation apps.

The out-of-control fires are blazing in parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, and nearly 200,000 people have been affected by mandatory evacuation orders. Winds of up to 80 miles per hour are exacerbating the conditions, and a state of emergency has been declared.

The fires have periodically closed major routes in the area, including Interstate 405 and Highway 101, making it more difficult for people to get around. The California Department of Transportation is providing an updated map that shows the locations of the areas affected by the fire.. LOS ANGELES During this week’s wildfires, navigation apps like Waze and Google Maps were guiding drivers into evacuation areas and caused congestion where officials were ordering streets closed, according to a motion introduced by Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz on Friday, Dec. 8.

drivers to those areas because the data indicated there was no traffic there.

“Cut-through traffic directed by Waze and other navigation apps has long created problems in many residential neighborhoods. But on the day of the

Skirball fire evacuation, drivers’ phones were navigating them into the fire zone, onto streets they weren’t familiar with,” Koretz told City News Service.

“Not only did it steer them into life-threatening danger, but it caused congestion where public safety officials were ordering streets cleared so residents under evacuation orders could safely get out and we could get our fire equipment in. With a simple change in the program code this could be avoided in the future,” he said.

The motion would direct the fire department and Department of Transportation to report on efforts to coordinate with navigation app developers to prevent their apps from directing drivers into evacuated areas.
