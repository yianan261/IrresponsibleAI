DHS/FBI and other .gov reports are often not as timely as one would hope, but if the government is taking the time to put something out, it is worth your time to read. Look for the timing on when the attack/data was from. Most of the time with these reports it is good to look back in time for indicators rather than setting up alerts. By the time the government has put something out the attackers have likely changed infrastructure or moved onto a new evolution of malware samples.

Commercial threat reports are often more timely than government reports, though they are also usually coming at the tail end of an investigation, so it may not be worth setting up alerts looking for future activity, especially when it comes to network-based indicators like IP addresses and domains that are often not active for long. Instead, look for attacker activities or behaviors to build detections – for example, did an attacker use a phishing email to get an attacker to download a file, which then launched an executable (like we saw with the recent exploitation of CVE-2017-1099)? In that case, blocking or alerting on executables launched from word documents would be a good detection. The more a detection can look for an attacker behavior rather than just a discreet indicator associated with a piece of malware the more effective that detection will be.

Researcher blogs are some of the best sources of intelligence on threats. They are usually timely and have good technical information, though they don’t always provide higher level details such as which industries are targeted or what the impact of an attack would be. Still, they are some of the best places to get information on how attacks are being carried out.

“When building detections from blogs, I look for what can be alerted on (IPs, domains, hashes or behaviors such as where a malware sample executes), the timing and what the threat is related to. When you have these pieces you can understand what the threat is and what to do if you see something alert,” Brown said.
