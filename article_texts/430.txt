A New Jersey mom taking her daughter to see a show featuring the Rockettes as part of a Girl Scouts field trip was recently ousted from the Radio City Music Hall because facial recognition technology identified her as a lawyer at a law firm that sued a related venue.

The lawyer, Kelly Conlon, is an associate at Davis, Saperstein & Salomon in New Jersey, which has sued a restaurant owned by Radio City owner the Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp.

She told NBC New York that a security guard stopped her in the Radio City lobby when she was there the weekend after Thanksgiving. Ars Technica noted the story.

“They knew my name before I told them. They knew the firm I was associated with before I told them. And they told me I was not allowed to be there,” Conlon told NBC New York.

Conlon waited outside, while her daughter saw the show.

Conlon said she is not personally involved in cases against Madison Square Garden Entertainment, and she doesn’t practice in New York. She told NBC New York that the experience was embarrassing and “mortifying.”

Madison Square Garden Entertainment sent this statement to NBC New York: “MSG instituted a straightforward policy that precludes attorneys pursuing active litigation against the company from attending events at our venues until that litigation has been resolved. While we understand this policy is disappointing to some, we cannot ignore the fact that litigation creates an inherently adverse environment. All impacted attorneys were notified of the policy, including Davis, Saperstein & Salomon, which was notified twice.”

Sam Davis, a partner at Davis Saperstein, told NBC New York that the ban “is absolutely absurd,” and the use of facial recognition technology to implement it is “frightening.” He plans to challenge Madison Square Garden Entertainment’s liquor license on the ground that it requires Madison Square Garden Entertainment to admit members of the public, unless they are disruptive or constitute a security threat.

Madison Square Garden Entertainment told NBC New York that safety is its highest priority, and facial recognition is just one method that it uses. The company also said it complies with all applicable laws, including New York liquor laws.

Conlon told NBC New York that she thought that a recent ruling in the case of another blacklisted firm made clear that ticket holders can’t be denied entry to shows. She may have been referring to a ruling in the case of a lawyer whose season tickets to New York Knicks games were revoked because of a suit against Madison Square Garden on behalf of ticket resellers.

In that suit, Judge Lyle E. Frank of New York ruled in November that New York civil rights law requires venues to allow entry to nonsporting events to anyone age 21 or older who is behaving appropriately and holding a valid ticket. But Madison Square Garden can refuse to sell tickets, and it can revoke tickets up until the time that they are presented at the door, Frank said.

After the decision, Madison Square Garden sent letters to lawyers with suits against it asserting that tickets that they obtain are revoked and invalid. The company also said it is appealing Frank’s decision.

On Nov. 22, a New York appeals court temporarily amended Frank’s decision, so that it applies only to the plaintiff who challenged Madison Square Garden Entertainment’s policy, Larry Hutcher, and to his firm, Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, Law360 reports. The narrowed ruling remains in effect pending a decision by the full appellate panel.. A lawyer employed by a firm involved in a personal injury claim against the operator of Radio City Music Hall said she was barred from attending the Rockettes Christmas show at the famous Manhattan venue after being picked up by facial recognition technology at the entrance.

Kelly Conlon told NBC New York she and her daughter came to the city from New Jersey last month as part of a Girl Scout field trip to see the show – but she was prevented from entering.

Conlon said: “It was pretty simultaneous, I think, to me, going through the metal detector, that I heard over an intercom or loudspeaker, I heard them say, ‘Woman with long dark hair and a grey scarf.’”

Conlon said she was asked her name and to produce identification.

“I believe they said that ‘Our recognition picked you up,’” she said. “They knew my name before I told them. They knew the firm I was associated with before I told them. And they told me I was not allowed to be there.”

Conlon is an attorney with Davis, Saperstein and Salomon, a law firm involved in a personal injury claim against MSG Entertainment, which operates Radio City Music Hall.

A sign at the venue says facial recognition is used as a security measure. Conlon said she posed no threat and was not involved in the personal injury case.

In a statement, MSG said it had “a straightforward policy that precludes attorneys pursuing active litigation against the company from attending events at our venues until that litigation has been resolved.

“While we understand this policy is disappointing to some … all impacted attorneys were notified of the policy, including Davis, Saperstein and Salomon, which was notified twice.”

MSG also said its priority was safety and it was confident it was “in compliance with all applicable laws”.

It added: “In this particular situation, only the one attorney who chose to attend was denied entry, and the rest of of her group – including the Girl Scouts – were all able to attend and enjoy the show.”

Conlon told NBC: “I was just a mom taking my daughter to see a Christmas show. I did wait outside … It was embarrassing, it was mortifying.”

Sam Davis, a partner at Davis, Saperstein and Salomon, said: “This whole scheme is a pretext for doing collective punishment on adversaries who would dare sue MSG in their multibillion-dollar network.

“… The liquor license that MSG got requires them to admit members of the public, unless there are people who would be disruptive who constitute a security threat … Separating a mother from her daughter and Girl Scouts she was watching over – and to do it under the pretext of protecting any disclosure of litigation information – is absolutely absurd.

“The fact they’re using facial recognition to do this is frightening. It’s un-American to do this.”
