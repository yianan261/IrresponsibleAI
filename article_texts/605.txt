A child psychiatrist in Charlotte was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in prison followed by 30 years of supervised release for the sexual exploitation of a minor and using artificial intelligence (AI) to create child pornography images of minors.

David Tatum, 41, was also ordered to pay restitution in an amount to be determined within 90 days, a $100 special assessment per count of conviction and a special assessment totaling $99,000 under the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act (AVAA). After he is released from prison, Tatum will also be required to register with the Sex Offender Registry Board in any state or jurisdiction where he works or resides.

"As a child psychiatrist, Tatum knew the damaging, long-lasting impact sexual exploitation has on the wellbeing of victimized children," ,” said U.S. Attorney Dena King for the western district of North Carolina. "Regardless, he engaged in the depraved practice of using secret recordings of his victims to create illicit images and videos of them. Tatum also misused artificial intelligence in the worst possible way: to victimize children. The 40-year sentence underscores our efforts to do all we can to bring justice to child victims. As the field of artificial intelligence advances, my office is committed to prosecuting predators who seek to exploit this technology to inflict harm on children."

"It is horrific to believe anyone would secretly record children undressing and showering for their own sexual gratification," said Special Agent Robert DeWitt of the FBI Charlotte Field Office. "And when the evidence proves that person is a doctor entrusted to help children through difficult mental health situations, it is inconceivable."

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, between 2016 and 2021, Tatum possessed images and videos of child pornography. In or about July 2016, Tatum secretly recorded a minor while the minor was undressing and showering. A forensic analysis of electronic devices revealed that Tatum produced the video of the minor and possessed it, along with other images and videos of child pornography. According to trial evidence, Tatum made similar recordings of others, including of his patient during an outpatient visit who had just turned 18 years old five days before the recording.

Trial evidence established that Tatum used AI to digitally alter clothed images of minors making them sexually explicit.

On May 4, a federal jury in Charlotte convicted Tatum of one count of production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography.

Tatum is currently in federal custody and will be transferred to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons upon designation of a federal facility.

The FBI investigated the case.

This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Justice Department.

A North Carolina child psychiatrist was hit with a 40-year prison sentence Wednesday for using artificial intelligence to transform innocent pictures of children into intense pornography stills.

David Tatum, 41, will also have to serve 30 years of supervised release for secretly recording multiple teenagers — including his several family members and a patient — getting undressed.

“It is horrific to believe anyone would secretly record children undressing and showering for their own sexual gratification. And when the evidence proves that person is a doctor entrusted to help children through difficult mental health situations, it is inconceivable,” Robert DeWitt, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in North Carolina, said in a statement.

The sentencing comes six months after Tatum was convicted of one count of production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography, and one count of possession of child pornography.

The child and adolescent psychiatrist spent five years collecting a trove of child pornography starting in 2016, according to evidence presented at his trial.

That year, he secretly recorded his 15-year-old cousin and other underage family members as they undressed and showered at a family vacation home in Maine.

Tatum recorded a former patient multiple times by directing a camera up her skirt during one of her therapy sessions. She had turned 18 just five days before the visit — but Tatum wrote she was only 17 in his notes, indicating he understood he was filming child pornography, according to court documents.

When his own videos were no longer enough, Tatum turned to a “deep fake” website to digitally alter clothed images of minors making them sexually explicit.

Two of the images Tatum used AI to modify were from a school dance and a photo commemorating the first day of school, officials said.

When he was finally caught in 2021, Tatum had over 1,000 child pornography titles, including videos containing the phrase “PTHC,” which stands for pre-teen hardcore, according to prosecutors.

Tatum later admitted to being a voyeur.

In addition to his sentence, Tatum was ordered to pay a $100 special assessment per count of conviction and a special assessment totaling $99,000 under the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act.

After he is released from federal prison, Tatum will be required to register as a sex offender.. 1/1 David Tatum, 41
