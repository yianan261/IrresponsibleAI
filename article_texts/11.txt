For generations, the Maasai people of eastern Africa have passed down the story of a tireless old man. He lived alone and his life was not easy. He spent every day in the fields — tilling the land, tending the animals, and gathering water. The work was as necessary as it was exhausting. But the old man considered himself fortunate. He had a good life, and never really gave much thought to what was missing.



One morning the old man was greeted with a pleasant surprise. Standing in his kitchen was a young boy, perhaps seven or eight years old. The old man had never seen him before. The boy smiled but said nothing. The old man looked around. His morning breakfast had already been prepared, just as he liked it. He asked the boy’s name. “Kileken,” the boy replied. After some prodding, the boy explained that, before preparing breakfast, he had completed all of the old man’s work for the day. Incredulous, the old man stepped outside. Indeed, the fields had been tilled, the animals tended, and the water gathered. Astonishment written all over his face, the old man staggered back into the kitchen. “How did this happen? And how can I repay you?” The boy smiled again, this time dismissively. “I will accept no payment. All I ask is that you let me stay with you.” The old man knew better than to look a gift horse in the mouth.



Kileken and the old man soon became inseparable, and the farm grew lush and bountiful as it never had before. The old man could hardly remember what life was like before the arrival of his young comrade. There could be no doubt: With Kileken’s mysterious assistance, the old man was prospering. But he never quite understood why, or how, it had happened.

To an extent we have failed to fully acknowledge, decision-making algorithms have become our society’s collective Kileken. They show up unannounced and where we least expect them, promise and often deliver great things, and quickly come to be seen as indispensable. Their reach can’t be overestimated. They tell traders what stocks to buy and sell, determine how much our car insurance costs, influence which products Amazon shows us and how much we get charged for them, and interpret our Google searches and rank their results.

These algorithms improve the efficiency and accuracy of services we all rely on, create new products we never before could have imagined, relieve people of tedious work, and are an engine of seemingly unbounded economic growth. They also permeate areas of social decision-making that have traditionally been left to direct human judgment, like romantic matchmaking and criminal sentencing. Yet they are largely hidden from view, remain opaque even when we are prompted to examine them, and are rarely subject to the same checks and balances as human decision-makers.

Worse yet, some of these algorithms seem to reflect back to us society’s ugliest prejudices. Last April, for instance, our Facebook feeds — curated by a labyrinth of algorithms — were inundated with stories about FaceApp, a program that applied filters to uploaded photographs so that the user would appear younger or older or more attractive. At first, this app seemed to be just another clever pitch to the Snapchat generation. But things quickly went sideways when users discovered that the app’s “hot” filter — which purported to transform regular Joes and Jills into beautiful Adonises and Aphrodites — made skin lighter, eyes rounder, and noses smaller. The app appeared to be equating physical attractiveness with European facial features. The backlash was swift, ruthless, and seemingly well-deserved. The app — and, it followed, the algorithm it depended on — appeared to be racist. The company first renamed the “hot” filter to “exclude any positive connotation associated with it,” before unceremoniously pulling it from the app altogether.

FaceApp’s hot filter was far from the first algorithm to be accused of racism, and certainly won’t be the last. Google’s autocomplete feature — which relies on an algorithm that scans other users’ previous searches to try to guess your query — is regularly chastised for shining a spotlight on racist, sexist, and other regressive sentiments that would otherwise remain tucked away in the darkest corners of the Internet and our psyches.

But while rogue apps or discomfiting autocomplete suggestions are both ephemeral and potentially responsive to public outcry, the same can hardly be said about the insidious encroachment of decision-making algorithms into the workings of our legal system, where they frequently play a critical role in determining the fates of defendants — and, like FaceApp, often exhibit a preference for white subjects. But the problem is more than skin deep. The issue is that we cannot escape the long arm of America’s history of racial discrimination just by writing an algorithm. The question is whether fairness requires more than simply crunching the numbers.

Algorithms in Criminal Sentencing

An algorithm is, in its most basic form, a well-defined procedure for solving a problem or making a decision. In this sense, the use of algorithms in the judicial system long predates not only the Big Data era but even the widespread integration of computers into our workplaces. The U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines — a manual of rules for helping judges efficiently determine fair sentences — are essentially a set of hyper-detailed algorithms meant to simplify and standardize judicial sentencing. And just as we’ve progressed from printing the original 1987 guidelines in bound volumes to making them easily accessible online, so too have we begun to employ computers to guide judicial choices using more advanced, software-based algorithms.

But the rough continuity between the earlier guidelines and computerized algorithms shouldn’t obscure just how much we as a society have in recent years ceded judicial agency to algorithms. Unlike the earlier guidelines, not only are the new algorithms executed by a computer rather than a person, but in many cases their workings are likely too abstruse to be understood, much less fairly administered, by a judge.

Courts across America have adopted a patchwork of different algorithms for a wide variety of tasks, and as a result there is no single algorithmic system that’s as ubiquitous as the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. One of the more prominent ones, however, is the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions system, a mouthful that condenses into the catchier acronym, COMPAS. It was first developed in 1998 by the for-profit consulting company Northpointe Institute for Public Management (recently rebranded as part of Equivant, a software company based in Ohio).

Northpointe’s aim was to develop a product that made accurate judgments on a defendant’s risk of recidivism, or re-offending. Often, judges use the risk scores produced by these algorithms to determine whether a person awaiting trial should be sent to jail or released, and whether or not a person convicted of a crime should be sentenced to prison, granted parole, or given the opportunity to receive the help he might need to get his life back on track.

Reporting differs on the extent to which judges can or do use the risk scores as a factor in determining the actual length of a prison sentence. The creators of risk assessment algorithms have been quoted in news articles insisting that their systems are intended only to suggest which defendants might be most eligible for alternatives to incarceration. The Assistant Attorney General for the state of Wisconsin, offering a more ambiguous picture, argued before the state Supreme Court that “the risk score alone should not determine the sentence of an offender.” Yet, judges have repeatedly cited high risk scores in their sentencing decisions, and admitted to reporters that they gave longer sentences than they would have had they not known the score.

COMPAS works by evaluating a range of factors including age, sex, personality traits, measures of social isolation, prior criminal history, family criminality, geography, and employment status. Northpointe gets some of this information from criminal records, and the rest from a questionnaire that asks defendants to respond to queries like, “How many of your friends/acquaintances are taking drugs illegally?” and to agree or disagree with statements like, “A hungry person has a right to steal.” Northpointe’s belief that they could improve on the performance of judges was based on the idea that, without the benefit of algorithmic assistance, even experienced jurists would make less consistent, more personal, and perhaps more biased evaluations as to the likelihood of re-offense.

It’s hard to know for sure whether Northpointe succeeded. Its researchers published a study in 2008 estimating the algorithm’s predictive accuracy to be 68 percent. Assuming this figure is correct, nobody — including Northpointe — can clearly say whether it’s good or bad or somewhere in between. Without context, the number is a cipher. Part of the issue stems from the word “accuracy” having different — and often contradictory — meanings in a statistical context and in everyday usage. The rest can be pinned on how easily our immediate intuitions can betray us when we try to interpret statistics. So rather than trusting our gut, it’s worth taking a moment to explore how COMPAS works and how to make sense of this 68 percent accuracy rating.

COMPAS does not offer a simple yes-or-no prediction as to whether someone will recidivate. Instead, for each criminal facing sentencing, COMPAS calculates a score, measured on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest), describing the risk that he will re-offend. Re-offending is defined as committing “a new misdemeanor or felony offense within two years of the COMPAS administration date.”

As it happens, there are many different ways to measure the predictive usefulness of this kind of test (the table “Measurements of Predictive Reliability” below offers an overview). Did people with high risk scores re-offend more often than people with low risk scores? Of the people who did not re-offend, were more of them rated low-risk than high-risk? The list goes on and on.

COMPAS uses a statistical metric known as the concordance index that encompasses all of these considerations. The concordance index measures the odds that any reoffender’s risk score is higher than any non-reoffender’s risk score. For COMPAS, the odds are 68 percent. (This measurement is statistically equivalent to the standard of accuracy, which measures the overall correctness of a test that issues only two ratings, high-risk and low-risk. Northpointe researchers largely use the two terms interchangeably, and this article will too.)

Making sense of what level of predictive accuracy counts as good, particularly in criminal sentencing, is far from straightforward. For starters, the minimum standard to beat is not 0 percent — which would mean that the predictions were always wrong — but 50 percent. This is the accuracy you’d expect to achieve if you assigned defendants’ risk scores randomly, because the odds that a reoffender’s risk score will be higher than a non-reoffender’s risk score will be the same as a coin toss. So one way to look at COMPAS’s accuracy level of 68 percent is that it’s significantly better than a random guess. But it’s also closer to a random guess than to a perfect prediction.

The Northpointe study’s authors explain that “a rule of thumb according to several recent articles” is that predictive accuracy of at least 70 percent is typically “satisfactory.” This level derives from many fields in which predictive measures are used, including medicine. While COMPAS did not meet this general standard overall, it’s in the ballpark. And for several specific types of predictions it actually exceeded that standard — for example, it achieved 80 percent accuracy in predicting whether women would go on to commit a personal offense (such as murder or assault).

But the important question should be why this — or any — “rule of thumb” ought to qualify as acceptable for criminal sentencing. The Northpointe study offers nothing aside from convention as a rationale for the 70-percent standard. It does not, for example, compare COMPAS to the accuracy of judges without algorithmic assistance. Rather than such a favorable comparison, or some independent criteria of justice, the 70-percent rule of thumb seems to be derived in reverse: Acceptable performance is whatever predictive measures are able to achieve.

Machine Bias?

Despite its questionable reliability, COMPAS has become one of the most widely used tools for assisting in judicial decision-making in America. This has made it a lightning rod for criticism — with the New York Times, for example, publishing a number of critical articles in the last few years. Still, despite the firestorm, the inner workings of the COMPAS algorithm, like those of its competitors, remain a fiercely guarded secret.

Attempting to find a way around COMPAS’s opacity, the investigative journalism group ProPublica recently conducted its own independent analysis. Through an open records request, ProPublica was able to obtain the COMPAS risk evaluations for 18,610 defendants who were scored in Broward County, Florida in 2013 and 2014. They then published their own analysis of the data in a widely discussed May 2016 article titled “Machine Bias.”

In ProPublica’s view, the results were less than encouraging. They found that “of those deemed likely to re-offend” — which ProPublica defined as an overall risk score of 5 or higher — “61 percent were arrested for any subsequent crimes within two years.”[1] They describe this result as “somewhat more accurate than a coin flip.” But ProPublica also found that “only 20 percent of the people predicted to commit violent crimes” — a risk score of 5 or higher specifically for violent crime — “actually went on to do so.” They deemed this result “remarkably unreliable.”

The headline criticism of ProPublica’s investigation, however, was not about COMPAS’s overall reliability but that its risk scores were racially biased. While black subjects were about equally distributed across the risk scores, white subjects were much more likely to be deemed “low-risk.” The black defendants did in fact have higher recidivism rates, but when ProPublica used statistical controls to adjust for the different recidivism rates, as well as for age, gender, and number of prior crimes, black defendants were still 45 percent more likely to be deemed “high-risk” than their similar white counterparts.

Risk Labels for Defendants Who Did Not Re-offend

Adding insult to injury, ProPublica found that COMPAS’s mistakes were also biased against black defendants. Among the people COMPAS labeled “high-risk,” the share who did in fact re-offend was only slightly higher for black subjects than for whites (see the figure “Predictive Precision” at right top). Some of the error rates, however, heavily disfavored the black subjects. Of those who did not go on to re-offend, the share who had mistakenly been labeled “high-risk” was nearly twice as high for black subjects as for whites (see the figure “False Positive Rates” at right bottom). From the other side, of the subjects who did re-offend, the share who had mistakenly been labeled “low-risk” was 48 percent for white subjects compared to just 28 percent for black subjects.

In other words, COMPAS was mistakenly lenient to white subjects about twice as often as to blacks, and mistakenly harsh to blacks about twice as often as to whites. The data seem to tell a tidy story: COMPAS has a tendency — despite its questionnaire ostensibly excluding race from consideration — to systematically give more unfavorable judgments to black defendants.

For added effect, the ProPublica authors’ statistical analyses were interwoven with a number of stories contrasting two people, always one black and one white, who had been convicted of similar crimes but were assigned very different COMPAS scores. Each time, the black defendant was deemed “high-risk” but did not re-offend, while the white defendant was deemed “low-risk” but did re-offend. There is not a lot of room to draw any conclusion besides the COMPAS algorithm being racially biased. It’s a compelling piece of journalism.

But, seen another way, the ProPublica piece can be read not as an indictment of COMPAS and other such tools as racist, but instead as an illustration of the daunting complexities inherent in applying our intuitive sense of justice to making fair statistical predictions. As we will see, it may even be impossible to fully satisfy our sense of justice when race enters the equation — at least in a society like ours, with a long history of racial discrimination.

Confusing Standards of Reliability

Northpointe, as you might expect, offered a vehement rejoinder to ProPublica’s analysis, which ProPublica in turn rebutted point by point. Numerous academic papers have also since been published on the subject. On close scrutiny, both Northpointe’s defense of its own system and a good deal of ProPublica’s criticism turn out to be questionable.

The devil is in the details. As we will repeatedly encounter, much of the dispute arises from the fact that there are many different ways to measure predictive reliability and error, several of which can easily be confused with one another.

For example, suppose we want to know how often COMPAS incorrectly judges defendants too harshly. One way we might measure mistaken harshness is in terms of how frequently people who are labeled “high-risk” did not go on to re-offend. This is known as the false discovery rate. Alternatively, we can measure mistaken harshness in terms of how often people who didn’t re-offend had been labeled “high-risk.” This is the false positive rate.

These are similar-sounding but different concepts, and even if one rate is the same for white and black defendants, the other might be quite different. In their exchanges, Northpointe and ProPublica sometimes fail to specify which measurement of reliability they’re referring to, or use the wrong term or an unclear description. To help avoid these kinds of confusion, I’ve included two tables with an overview of different measurements of predictive reliability and error.

Measurements of Predictive Reliability Applies to risk‑rating type Type of reliability Measures the likelihood that… → Better-than-random guess must have reliability above Accuracy “high‑risk” vs. “low‑risk” Correctness of all predictions Any

defendant Is predicted correctly 50% Concordance index 1‑to‑10 risk scores Relative correctness of risk ratings Any reoffender’s risk score Is higher than any non-reoffender’s risk score 50% Precision “high‑risk” vs. “low‑risk” Correctness of predictions of re‑offense A defendant labeled “high‑risk” Re‑offends The overall re‑offense rate Measurements of Prediction Error Type of mistake Measures the likelihood that a defendant who… → Complementary correctness rate (the two always add to 100%) False positive rate Mistaken harshness Doesn’t re‑offend Was labeled “high‑risk” Specificity False discovery rate Mistaken harshness Is labeled “high‑risk” Doesn’t re‑offend Precision False negative rate Mistaken leniency Re‑offends Was labeled “low‑risk” Sensitivity

A related problem is that the standards for what counts as good reliability differ from one measurement to the next. The standard of accuracy mentioned before refers to the algorithm’s overall correctness, and so incorporates both the high-risk and low-risk predictions. In this case, ProPublica’s comparison to the accuracy of a coin flip is appropriate. (ProPublica’s own estimate pins COMPAS’s overall accuracy at 66 percent — not too far off from Northpointe’s claim of 68 percent.)

But there are many ways to judge the reliability of a predictive system, each of which tells a different, and often conflicting, story. If we look instead just at the people who were predicted to re-offend, the standard to beat shouldn’t be a coin flip, but instead however often people actually do re-offend. If, say, 60 percent of the overall population went on to re-offend, the “high-risk” population would need to re-offend significantly more than 60 percent of the time to consider the algorithm better than a random guess. This isn’t a question of “accuracy” — the word ProPublica confusingly uses — but what statisticians call precision.

With that in mind, let’s look at how the COMPAS predictions that ProPublica analyzed compared to the actual recidivism rates: The 61 percent re-offense rate among “high-risk” defendants compared to a 45 percent re-offense rate among all defendants, and the 20 percent rate of new violent crimes among “violent high-risk” defendants compared to an 11 percent rate among all defendants.[2] In other words, a person deemed generally high-risk was a third more likely than the overall group to actually commit another offense, and a person deemed violently high-risk was almost twice as likely as the overall group to commit a violent offense. Quantitatively and qualitatively, this feels very different than saying the algorithm has an accuracy of 68 percent.

But the central problem persists: None of these analyses say much of anything about what counts as a just level of predictive accuracy. Even if 20 percent predictive precision is better than a random guess, we may still have good reason to reject it as simply too low to justly use in determining someone’s fate. We are asking statistics to meet competing standards of justice while relying on murky intuitions of what those standards are, and without asking whether it is even possible to meet them all at once.
