We all know that without gambling and porn, there never would have been an internet at all, so we pay that price for the other conveniences it has added to our lives. However, it's still a little unsettling when the seedier (immoral, disgusting, misogynistic, offensive) aspects get blown into the mainstream. Maybe it shouldn't be. Maybe we should be more willing to be aware of and admit what companies are doing (and the customers who are paying them to do it) with the ever increasing capabilities of technology... in this case...generative AI. This company's advertised capabilities and examples stop just short of illegality as far as I can tell, and their terms of service say they don't allow uploads or creation of illegal content. But the AI doesn't know the difference - it's just going to create what it's learned, and there's plenty out there for it to have learned from. I find it almost impossible to believe that pedophiles (and incels and every other deviant) won't find their way around whatever controls are in place, if any. DOJ clearly says (https://lnkd.in/e3DtyakY) that "visual representations, such as drawings, cartoons, or paintings that appear to depict minors engaged in sexual activity and are obscene are also illegal under federal law." So we don't need to bemoan the void of not having an "AI Law" - but we do need to find ways to apply and enforce the ones we have. Patrick tagged the DOJ; I don't know if there's enough here to engage the FTC as well or not. I'd sure enjoy seeing some sanctioned red-teaming of this site to push the boundaries and find out what they really allow - especially if it leads to their being closed down, and sending messages to others. Yes - there will always be porn, and a dark web, and the worst parts of humanity. But even whack-a-mole does actually take out a few moles along the way. Sometimes that may be the win.
