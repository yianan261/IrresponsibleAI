P kj = (1-r j )C kj + r j (C kj + q kj - p kj )

For such a short string of algebraic symbols, there is a lot we can learn from Ofqual’s grading algorithm (though really it is an equation) – and a lot we can learn about what went wrong.

First and most obviously, the size of the algorithm is an issue. With just four distinct terms – C kj , q kj , p kj and r j – it shows the sparseness of the inputs. This is not a “big data” solution, gathering every possible piece of information about a student in an attempt to gain a full view of their capability. In fact, it is the opposite: using the smallest possible amount of information, so it can be rapidly gathered and easily standardised.

So what are those terms? The first are three various distributions of grades, k, at schools, j. C kj is simple enough: it is the historical grade distribution at the school over the last three years, 2017-19.

That tells us already that the history of the school is very important to Ofqual. The grades other pupils got in previous years is a huge determinant to the grades this year’s pupils were given in 2020. The regulator argues this is a plausible assumption but for many students it is also an intrinsically unfair one: the grades they are given are decided by the ability of pupils they may have never met.

q kj is where the pupils’ own ability comes in. That is the predicted grade distribution based on the class’s prior attainment at GCSEs. A class with mostly 9s (the top grade) at GCSE will get a lot of predicted A*s; a class with mostly 1s at GCSEs will get a lot of predicted Us.

p kj is the predicted grade distribution of the previous years, based on their GCSEs. You need to know that because, if previous years were predicted to do poorly and did well, then this year might do the same; and, again, vice versa.

The final term, r j , is different: it is not about grades at all, hence the absence of the k. Instead, it is about how many pupils in the class actually have historical data available. If you can perfectly track down every GCSE result, then it is 1; if you cannot track down any, it is 0.

Finally, we can put the terms together. First, the equation is in two halves, one multiplied by that r j term, and one multiplied by one minus r j , meaning the higher r j is, the lower 1-r j will be. What that says is: “If we don’t know about this group’s GCSE grades, ignore the right half of this equation, and just base everything on last year’s A-levels; to the extent that we do know about their GCSE grades, use that information as well.”

It’s a robust system, it’s a fair system, it’s making sure that young people get the grades that they’ve worked so hard towards” Nick Gibb, 12 August, to Sky News “Most young people … will get the grade that the teacher sent in to the exam board that they thought they would get.” Gavin Williamson, 13 August, to Sky News Q) “Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will not be forced into the embarrassing U-turn that John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon were in Scotland?”

There’s been no checks and balances in that system; it degrades every single grade as a result and in-baked unfairness” Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

The left half, which only gets used if we do not know the GCSE data, is that simple: “Just use the historical A-level results.” And then the right half says: “Use the historical A-level results, but add to them the predictions from this year’s GCSE results, then downgrade them based on how good the last lot of predictions were.” That means a school that regularly gets good A-level results despite having bad GCSEs will get a boost.

Aggregating all those terms together gives us P kj , the predicted grades for the school.

Even in this short equation, we can see the seeds of a fiasco: prior attainment based exclusively on GCSE results; historical grades stretching back just three years; and a refusal to allow the actual success of the pupil to overrule the situation.

In a better system, perhaps the rest of the process could have ironed out these flaws, but in reality they made them worse.

The decision to give small classes the ability to receive their teachers’ recommended grades is not in the algorithm but led to a boost for elite private schools.

The choice to take the results of the algorithm and further tweak the grade boundaries to prevent overall grade inflation is not in the algorithm but further depressed the larger classes in favour of the smaller.

And the choice to focus, not on determining individual grades, but on determining a distribution for a class which students were then matched to on the basis of their rank in the class, is not an error in the algorithm but a fundamental misunderstanding of what the goal was.. Ofqual was warned at least a month ago of flaws in the exams algorithm that left thousands of students devastated, but the regulator pressed ahead amid longstanding ministerial pressure to prevent grade inflation, the Guardian understands.

External advisers told the regulator that its formula for deciding England’s pupils’ A-level and GCSE results after the cancellation of exams was “volatile” and risked producing erratic outcomes, sources said.

Despite the warnings, that formula was kept in place, leading to a fiasco that saw disadvantaged students worst hit by downgrades, until the government was forced into a U-turn on Monday.

The disclosure raises questions about the extent of ministers’ knowledge of the concerns. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has claimed he only became aware of the scale of the unfairness of the algorithm “over the weekend” when the full detail was published, though a government source said he had raised earlier concerns about the model and sought reassurances from Ofqual.

Universities have warned of mounting chaos as students scramble for places armed with new teacher-assessed grades. Ucas revealed on Wednesday that 15,000 pupils originally rejected by their first-choice university now have the grades to meet their offer, with 90% of them aiming to study at top-tier universities.

With at least one over-subscribed university resorting to the offer of financial sweeteners to persuade students to defer until 2021, the National Union of Students (NUS) organised protests in six cities over ongoing inequalities in the fallout of the crisis and concerns that disadvantaged students will be forced to take gap years.

In late March, with schools closed and the pandemic gathering pace, Williamson publicly warned Ofqual it “should ensure, as far as is possible, that qualification standards are maintained and the distribution of grades follows a similar profile to that in previous years”. The demand was made in a letter to the head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, on 31 March, issued as a ministerial direction under the Children and Learning Act of 2009.

The diktat from Williamson is understood to have been the overriding concern that led Ofqual to reject warnings from its external advisers before the algorithm was finalised in July.

The schools minister, Nick Gibb, was also identified by one senior Conservative source as having piled on pressure to keep grade inflation down. “Nick must take some of the blame. He has a tin ear, and he’s obsessed with avoiding grade inflation,” the source said.

The Times also reported that Jon Coles, chief executive of the United Learning schools trust, warned Williamson last month that Ofqual’s system would unfairly grade pupils, in a letter and a subsequent call. But Williamson declined to act after receiving “reassurances” from Ofqual, according to a source quoted by the paper.

Williamson finally admitted on Wednesday that Ofqual was responsible for the climbdown – for which he originally took credit – and insisted the regulator had his “full confidence”. He had previously refused to back Collier.

“The decision they [Ofqual] took to move from moderated grades to centre-assessed grades was one that we agreed with,” the Department for Education (DfE) said.

That statement appeared to contradict an assertion from Williamson in interviews on Tuesday, where he originally said there were “large numbers of youngsters … [who] wanted to see action taken, that’s what I’ve done”.

Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, welcomed Williamson’s change of tone in respect of Ofqual. “Throwing the very people you need to fix the issue under the nearest bus, simply to affect the next morning’s headline, is no way to run any organisation successfully,” Penman said.

“This government already has an instinct to brief and undermine the very public servants who are delivering public services in the most extraordinary of circumstances. Watching ministers scapegoat them live on the news channels will only have further undermined the trust that is so vital between ministers and civil servants.”

A Whitehall source said there had been agreement across government – and cross-party – about the need for moderation of exam results, rather than pressure coming solely from ministers. “There was agreement from the sector, from teaching unions, from the SNP, from Labour in Wales, and there was a full consultation, everyone was aligned on the need to protect the integrity of grades,” the source said.

“There were challenges made to Ofqual and assurances were received but ultimately everyone was working together to try and get a fair system and try and avoid grade inflation. And now it is down to a choice between inflation and equality – but we are in a pandemic and [pandemics] cause havoc.”

In another potential headache for the department, Labour’s Charlie Falconer, the shadow attorney general, said the algorithms formula was unlawful, and ministers should have been aware under the 2009 act which set out Ofqual’s obligations and under anti-discrimination legislation.

Lord Falconer said Williamson’s claim to have only become aware of the issues around the algorithm at the weekend was concerning, citing an education select committee report in July that had raised concerns over pupils from “well-heeled and sharp-elbowed” families benefiting.

He said Williamson must now confirm when exactly the DfE was made aware of concerns about the algorithm and publish any legal advice it had received about the formula.

The NUS has organised protests for 1pm on Thursday outside DfE buildings in London, Bristol, Coventry, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester.

The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, said students should remember the anger they felt when they got their results and use it to mobilise politically. On a Zoom call hosted by Young Labour with more than 100 young people, she said: “Remember and keep hold of that anger, that upset, about the injustice this government tried to get away with. Ruining the dreams of thousands.

“Remember how you felt when the government made it clear they didn’t care about our young people. Take that and don’t forget about it.”

Ofqual was approached for comment.
