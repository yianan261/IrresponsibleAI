We received this heartbreaking email by someone who is falsely being accused of using "AI" to generate an essay and was given ZERO on their assignment. How many people's lives are being ruined like this? This should be unacceptable. 

===============

Hello,

My name is XX. I am a XXX year old XXX student at XXX. I am currently being falsely accused of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) on an assignment of mine. The AI detector is used through the company "Turnitin".

I am contacting you because I am interested in discussing this subject with someone who is willing to listen. I have contacted Turnitin's support multiple times and they refuse to provide me with any help. I initially took this up with my professor, however, he is unwilling to listen to me. I then proceeded to the department head, and she is choosing not to respond to me at all. I am receiving a zero on an assignment that I wrote by hand.

I am attaching the "AI report" of my assignment to this email. It states that 67% of my paper was written by AI, which is untrue. I am trying to understand exactly what makes these sentences so special? Why does my writing appear to be AI generated? I have tried understanding Turnitin's methods of distinguishing AI, and I still do not see how it fits within my writing. Is there any chance you may shed some light on the situation? If this zero ends up affecting my final grade, I will be submitting an appeal. If that doesn't work, then I will be taking the issue to my local news networks.

I really enjoy writing, and take my time to ensure the quality is professional. I currently stand with a 4.0 GPA and am a member of the President's Honor Roll at my University. I makes me ill to see so many honest students, such as myself, being falsely accused of cheating. I hope you will take my situation into consideration. If this email is not appropriate for your organization, then please disregard it.
