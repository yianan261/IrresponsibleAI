Regulators Launch New Investigation Into Cruise Self-Driving Cars After Pedestrians Hit By Robotaxis
Cruise, the self-driving arm of General Motors, is being investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the company shared two incident reports of pedestrians being injured by its robotaxis.
Regulators are investigating whether Cruise is making necessary measures to keep pedestrians safe from its self-driving vehicles.

The NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation said the reports involve Cruise cars “encroaching on pedestrians present in or entering roadways, including pedestrian crosswalks, in the proximity of the intended travel path of the vehicles.”

In addition to receiving the incident reports about pedestrians, the NHTSA found two other incidents related to Cruise vehicles through videos online.

One incident was reported just over two weeks ago in San Francisco where a pedestrian was hit by a hit-and-run driver into another lane, then hit again by a Cruise vehicle.

The ODI said it does not know the current number of related pedestrian incidents.

Cruise told Forbes it regularly holds meetings with the NHTSA to discuss questions from the agency.
The NHTSA investigation is its second involving Cruise in less than a year, after the agency opened a probe last December following three incident reports about Cruise vehicles being rear-ended by cars after braking too quickly. At the time, the agency said the vehicles “may engage in inappropriately hard braking or become immobilized.” Cruise said it would continue cooperating with the NHTSA and other regulators because “there’s always a balance between healthy regulatory scrutiny and the innovation we desperately need to save lives.” The California Department of Motor Vehicles opened an investigation in August after a Cruise vehicle crashed with an emergency vehicle in San Francisco. The company agreed to cut its fleet in half during the DMV investigation, saying it would have a maximum of 50 autonomous cars in operation during the day, and up to 150 at night.

“Cruise’s safety record over 5 million miles continues to outperform comparable human drivers at a time when pedestrian injuries and deaths are at an all-time high,” Hannah Lindow, a spokesperson for Cruise, said in a statement shared with Forbes.
