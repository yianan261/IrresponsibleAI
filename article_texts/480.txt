Twitch, which is largely dedicated to gaming streams, “is a male-dominated space,” Anita said. According to StreamScheme , 78.4% of Twitch users are male, and 19.6% are female. Women also are a small minority of Twitch’s top-earning content creators. According to a 2021 leak that contained the earnings of the platform’s top performers, only 3% of the top 100 were women.



Anita said she has been the subject of “cum tributes” — videos in which men ejaculate onto images of her — and compilations of her streaming footage edited in a lascivious manner. “If I stopped myself from doing things that people can masturbate to, I wouldn't leave my house,” Anita said. “I gave up trying to deal with it, and I just tried to focus on what I do love about my job.”

Still, Anita said she is “looking into” legal action over the deepfakes of her. Meanwhile, other streamers featured in the deepfakes have hired lawyer Ryan Morrison, whose Los Angeles–based firm sent takedown notices to sites where the content was being hosted. (It’s unclear whether the original creator took down their content before or after these takedowns were issued.)



"There's no appropriate way to use someone's content or likeness without their consent," Morrison told BuzzFeed News. “Deepfakes themselves are newer to the ecosystem of porn. The deepfake technology is getting to a point where it looks real, it can come across as legitimate.” Morrison declined to reveal the women he’s representing so as not to bring more harassment their way but said they also were considering legal action.. As one of many streamers who have been objectified and exploited by the deepfaked lewd photo plague gaining traction after Atrioc inadvertently exposed it to thousands of viewers, QTCinderella vowed to sue the person responsible for creating that particular website.

The Twitch star said being exposed to something like that should not be part of her job, nor should she need to pay money to make sure it’s taken down, but the fact she has to is exhausting. “To the person that made that website, I’m going to fucking sue you,” she said during her Jan. 30 stream. “I promise you. With every part of my soul, I’m going to fucking sue you. That’s all I have to say.”

QTCinderella admitted she was hesitant to make a statement on stream but ultimately decided to because she wanted people—especially those involved in some way—to see the toll a situation like this can take on any person.

QTCinderella also said she doesn’t condone the behavior of anyone involved, including Atrioc and all the people who don’t seem to see the issue with viewing deepfake content like that.

“If you are able to look at women who are not selling themselves or benefiting off of being seen sexually. They’re not benefitting. They’re not selling it. They’re not platforming it themselves. If you are able to look at that, then you are the problem,” she said. “You see women as an object. You should not be okay doing that.”

In a separate post, she also called out journalists and social media reporters for covering the situation insensitively by advertising the website and, in turn, spreading the images—intentionally or otherwise.

Some U.S. states, including California, New York, Texas, and Virginia, already have laws in place for issues like this. The U.K. is also reportedly planning to make sharing non-consensual explicit deepfake content a crime in England and Wales. It seems like only a matter of time before others follow suit.

Twitch streamer QTCinderella has vented her frustration with the inadequacies of the US legal system after she couldn’t find a lawyer to file a suit against the owner of a website that published deepfake porn videos depicting her.

She had previously vowed to sue the porn site hosting the deepfakes in an emotional livestream, saying: "And to the person that made that website, I'm going to fucking sue you. I promise you, with every part of my soul. I'm going to fucking sue you."

QTCinderella and other female Twitch stars discovered that deepfake porn using their faces was available online in a viral clip from fellow streamer Atrioc, who afterwards apologized for the incident. He stepped down from content creation in the aftermath of this scandal, stating that he’d help cover legal fees for those who want to try and combat such porn websites.

In an interview with NBC News, QTCinderella commented that the response she got from the lawyers she spoke to, who are familiar with the issue, was “disheartening”.

“Every single lawyer I’ve talked to essentially has come to the conclusion that we don’t have a case,” she told NBC. “There’s no way to sue the guy.”

While regulation of deepfakes is under way in the UK, where the use of one’s image for deepfakes without consent and permission will be punishable, the US has no such legal tools available to victims right now. That makes it very difficult to legally combat the creators of this sort of content.

The incident had another effect on QTCinderella, which she opened up about towards NBC: body dysmorphia. “When you see a porn star’s body so perfectly grafted onto where yours should be,” the streamer said, “it’s the most obvious game of comparisons that you could ever have in your life. I cried and was like ‘my body will never be like that.’”

Another one of the victims, Sweet Anita, recently said that while “there isn’t any moving on” from the incident for her, she is skeptical about the effect of legal measures. “Frankly, you can change the law, but the law won’t change anything until the culture does”, she commented.. A popular gamer on Twitch has tearfully revealed she is the latest high-profile victim of deepfake porn, with predators pasting her face into a pre-existing adult video to make it seem she legitimately appeared in the kinky clip.

QTCinderella, a 28-year-old American whose real name is Blaire, went live on the streaming site last week to lash out at the cyber sickos who made the video, as well as a prominent male Twitch star who had admitted to buying deepfake porn.

“I’m so exhausted and I think you guys need to know what pain looks like because this is it,” the gamer wept. “This is what it looks like to feel violated. This is what it feels like to be taken advantage of, this is what it looks like to see yourself naked against your will being spread all over the internet. This is what it looks like.”

She then took aim at gamer Atrioc who had earlier told fans that he purchased two doctored clips featuring other famous female Twitch stars, prompting a spike in traffic to the deepfake porn site.

“F- -k the f- -king internet. F- -k Atroic for showing it to thousands of people. F- -k the people DMing me pictures of myself from that website. F- -k you all! This is what it looks like, this is what the pain looks like,” QTCinderella continued during her emotional livestream.

“To the person that made that website, I’m going to f- -king sue you,” she vowed. “I promise you, with every part of my soul I’m going to f- -king sue you.”

The Post has reached out to QTCinderella for further comment.

Given the rapid advancement of technology, it’s difficult to distinguish deepfake porn from legitimately filmed videos, adding to the distress experienced by victims who insist they weren’t party to the production. Laws have also not kept up with current online activity, meaning it may prove difficult for QTCinderella to sue the person who created the disturbing, doctored video.

Tech writer River Page first reported on the Twitch star’s deepfake horror. In his essay, republished by the Free Press, Page explained that “there is a federal revenge porn law that allows victims of nonconsensual porn to file lawsuits against perpetrators, but the law doesn’t address deepfakes specifically.”

“A federal law should be in place,” Page further wrote. “Will it stop deepfake porn? Not completely. Federal law hasn’t eliminated the production and distribution of child pornography either, but the enforcement of those laws has driven the practice to the extreme margins, and has attached a heavy cost to participating in the trade.”

At present, cyber pervs use software involving machine learning or artificial intelligence to create deepfakes with relative ease — and with little fear of prosecution.

Celebs such as Scarlett Johansson and Emma Watson have been the victims of deepfake porn videos, and some sleazebags are charging just $20 to create fabricated videos of exes, co-workers, friends, enemies and classmates.

Robert Chesney from the University of Texas and Danielle Citron from the University of Maryland have said the damage from being a victim of deepfake porn can be “profound.”

“Victims may feel humiliated and scared,” they wrote in a 2019 research paper. “When victims discover that they have been used in fake sex videos, the psychological damage may be profound — whether or not this was the aim of the creator of the video.”

The damage appears to be obvious QTCinderella, but some on social media have expressed little sympathy.

“I don’t get the big deal at all. Like, there could be terabytes of photoshopped porn of me, and I wouldn’t care… because I’m not actually experiencing those scenarios being depicted. It’s literally not real,” one Twitter user wrote.

“I get being upset But if you’re crying over people putting your face on a pornstar then maybe you’re too soft for the internet It’s wild out here,” another declared.
