The person behind the wheel of the Uber self-driving Volvo SUV that struck and killed a woman in Arizona was likely streaming "The Voice" on a cellphone at the time of the incident.

The Tempe Police Department released a 318-page document late Thursday that sheds new light on what likely happened when the vehicle hit pedestrian Elaine Herzberg, 49, in March as she walked a bicycle across a road in Tempe. According to an analysis of the incident, police said "the crash was deemed entirely avoidable."

The test driver, Rafaela Vasquez, who was hired by Uber to sit behind the wheel and take over in case of emergencies, had both personal and business phones in the car at the time of the crash. Tempe Police Department's investigation requested data from Hulu, YouTube and Netflix as part of its investigation. The apps were found on one or both of Vasquez's phones.

According to data provided by Hulu, the driver was streaming NBC's popular show "The Voice" on the Hulu app for about 40 minutes. The end time coincides with the crash. Netflix and YouTube reportedly weren't in use.

During nine video segments obtained from the vehicle's dashcam, Vasquez looked down 204 times. The report states each of those times had "the same eye placement at the lower center console near the area of her right knee."

Vasquez's eyes were averted for a total of more than six minutes, or 3.67 miles out of 11.8 miles traveled during the trip. Vasquez had previously told National Transportation Safety Board investigators in a post-crash interview that the phones weren't in use.

Vasquez could face charges for vehicular manslaughter, according to Tempe Police Department.

Vasquez could not immediately be reached for comment.

Uber said it is cooperating with ongoing investigations and conducting its own internal safety review.

"We have a strict policy prohibiting mobile device usage for anyone operating our self-driving vehicles. We plan to share more on the changes we'll make to our program soon," according to an Uber spokesperson

The spokesperson added that any physical mobile device usage while the vehicle is on the road is a fireable offense.

The crash was a major setback for Uber's self-driving car operation. In May, Uber said it was ending self-driving car testing in Arizona and laying off 300 Uber workers. The company said it would focus on its autonomous vehicle efforts in San Francisco and Pittsburgh.

This is the latest development in the ongoing investigation into the fatal crash. In May, the National Transportation Safety Board determined Uber's self-driving car accurately identified Herzberg, but Uber had turned off the vehicle's automatic emergency braking, so the SUV did not attempt to brake. The feature was disabled to reduce the potential for unwanted braking, such as for a plastic bag in the road.

Earlier this year, Uber said it employs about 400 human safety drivers like Vasquez across various cities.

CNNMoney's Matt McFarland contributed to this report. ARIZONA (BLOOMBERG) - The backup "safety driver" in an Uber Technologies self-driving vehicle that killed a pedestrian in March was streaming the popular television show The Voice on her mobile phone in the moments before the crash, according to police in Arizona.

A 318-page report filed by the Tempe Police Department refutes driver Rafaela Vasquez's previous statement to federal safety investigators that she wasn't using her mobile devices when the car struck and killed a woman who was crossing the street at night.

Police were able to obtain records of Vasquez's account from the television streaming service Hulu LLC, which showed she'd streamed the talent show for 42 minutes on the night of the March 18 crash. Her stream ended at 9.59pm, around the same time Elaine Herzberg, 49, was hit by the Uber, which was in self-driving mode, the report said.

Police concluded in the report that the crash was "entirely avoidable" and said Vasquez could face vehicular manslaughter charges.

Emergency Braking Sensors on the Uber Volvo SUV's system had detected Herzberg six seconds before the impact and recognized that it was going to crash 1.3 seconds prior, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. But the system couldn't activate the brakes because, according to Uber, emergency braking isn't enabled while the vehicle is under computer control, the report said. The responsibility for braking was left up to Vasquez - who didn't look up until 0.5 seconds before the accident.

Vasquez was looking away from the road for long stretches in the time before the crash, according to an internal video showing her that was released by police. She told NTSB investigators she was monitoring the self-driving system's interface. Vasquez couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

A spokesperson for Uber said the company continues to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations while conducting our own internal safety review, adding that Uber policy prohibits mobile device usage for anyone operating its self-driving vehicles.. SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber is pulling its self-driving cars out of Arizona. The ride-sharing company's reversal was triggered by the recent death of woman who was run over by one of its robotic vehicles while crossing a darkened street in a Phoenix suburb.

The decision announced Wednesday means Uber won't be bringing back its self-driving cars to the streets to Arizona, eliminating the jobs of about 300 people who served as backup drivers and performed other jobs connected to the vehicles.

Uber had suspended testing of its self-driving vehicles in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto while regulators investigated the cause of a March 18 crash that killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg in Tempe, Arizona. It marked the first death involving a fully autonomous vehicle, raising questions about the safety of computer-controlled cars being built by Uber and dozens of other companies, including Google spin-off Waymo.

Tempe police said, meanwhile, that they have completed a report into the fatal March crash. They said the in-depth traffic collision investigation was submitted Wednesday to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for review. It's still considered an active investigation and police aren't releasing the report or any details of their investigation.

Uber still plans to build and test self-driving cars, which the San Francisco company considers to be critical to maintaining its early lead in the ride-hailing market. This as Waymo and other rivals prepare to enter the field with robotic vehicles that may be able to offer cheaper fares.

In a Wednesday statement, Uber said its self-driving cars will return to Pittsburgh this summer. The company said it is focusing its efforts to build self-driving cars in that city as well as in San Francisco, although it didn't make a commitment to bring its robotic vehicles back to the streets of California, where it no longer has a permit to operate them after allowing its license in that state to expire earlier this year.

About 550 Uber employees will remain in Arizona working on its other operations in the state, including its traditional ride-hailing service with cars driven by humans responding to requests made through a mobile app.

Uber brought a fleet of self-driving cars to Arizona at the end of 2016, just days after the vehicles were banned from California for not having the proper permits at that time.

California's action prompted Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to send out a derisive tweet in an effort to persuade Uber to bring its self-driving cars to his state. "This is what OVER-regulation looks like!" Ducey wrote.

Ducey prohibited Uber from continuing its tests of self-driving cars after Herzberg was run over, a ban that a spokesman said Wednesday remains in effect.

"The governor's focus has always been on what's best for Arizonans and for public safety, not for any one company," said Ducey spokesman Daniel Scarpinato.

The fatal collision involving Uber's self-driving car added to the headaches vexing CEO Dara Khosrowshahi as he tries to repair the damage done by a regime led by his predecessor, Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick. The company is trying to recover from a wave of revelations and allegations about rampant sexual harassment in Uber's workforce, a cover-up of a massive data breach , dirty tricks and stolen trade secrets .

Khosrowshahi has promised he won't allow Uber's self-driving cars back on public roads again until he is convinced the vehicles are safe. That won't happen until Uber completes "a top-to-bottom safety review," according to a statement the company issued Wednesday. As part of that process, Uber hired Christopher Hart, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, to review its self-driving car program.

Meanwhile, Waymo is preparing to launch a ride-hailing service in Arizona that will pick up passengers in robotic cars that won't have humans to take control if the vehicle malfunctions. The service is supposed to begin before the end of this year.. The crash of an Uber self-driving car that killed an Arizona woman in March was “entirely avoidable,” according to police reports released by the Tempe Police Department. Cellphone data obtained by police suggests that the Uber operator was also streaming an episode of reality show The Voice at the time of the fatal incident.

The documents, released to Gizmodo in response to a public records request, show that Tempe police found that the operator of the Uber autonomous vehicle could likely have avoided the fatal crash, had she been paying attention—but instead she was likely watching a video on her phone. Police also noted that Uber’s vehicles apparently did not alert operators to take over the vehicle during incidents.

After the crash, Uber laid off 300 test drivers from its autonomous vehicle unit and halted testing in Arizona. An Uber spokesperson noted that using any device behind the wheel, even a smartwatch, would be considered a fireable offense.

The crash killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman who was walking across the street with a bicycle when she was struck by the Uber vehicle. Uber’s autonomous technology failed to detect Herzberg, and the human driver who was supposed to act as a safeguard appeared distracted in previously released footage. Now, several documents in the 318-page report suggest the driver, Rafaela Vasquez, may have been streaming an episode of The Voice at the time of the crash.

“The driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian,” one of the documents concluded.

However, Tempe police also noted that Uber’s vehicles did not alert autonomous vehicle operators about when to take control of their cars.

“During the current development phase, vehicle operators are relied upon to perform evasive maneuvers,” one Tempe detective wrote. “I was not able to find anywhere in the literature that the self-driving systems alerts the vehicle operator to potential hazards or when they should take manual control of the vehicle to perform an evasive maneuver.” Uber’s spokesperson said that the company is reviewing safety practices and procedures and has hired former National Transportation Safety Board chair Christopher Hart as a safety advisor.

In a statement, an Uber spokesperson said the company’s policy prohibits drivers of its autonomous vehicles from using mobile devices while behind the wheel.

“We continue to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations while conducting our own internal safety review. We have a strict policy prohibiting mobile device usage for anyone operating our self-driving vehicles,” the spokesperson told Gizmodo. “We plan to share more on the changes we’ll make to our program soon.”

Following the crash, police obtained warrants for work and personal cellphones belonging to Vasquez. Police also sent search warrants to YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu to recover Vasquez’s viewing history on her devices around the time of the accident.

“The driver in this case could have reacted and brought the vehicle to a stop 42.61 feet prior to the pedestrian.”

The crash occurred around 10pm—more specifically, the report states that video from inside the car “ceases recording with a UTC time of 4:58:50 [9:58pm local time], just moments after striking the pedestrian.”

The data Hulu provided to authorities shows Vasquez was streaming an episode of The Voice called “The Blind Auditions, Part 5" between 9:16pm and 9:59pm local time, according to account history turned over to the police by Hulu’s legal team. In response to the warrants, YouTube and Netflix said that Vasquez was not actively viewing video on either platform at the time of the crash.

Hulu’s legal team initially released viewing data for another user’s account, according to the police reports, then corrected the error in response to follow-up questions from the Tempe police and released Vasquez’s data.



In reviewing footage collected from Uber’s own cameras, which filmed the car’s view of the road and Vasquez as she was driving, police determined that Vasquez was frequently distracted.

“She appears to be looking down at the area near her right knee at various points in the video,” the report reads. “During the 9 video clips, I found that the driver looked down 204 times with nearly all of them having the same eye placement at the lower center console near her right knee. One hundred sixty-six of these instances of looking down occurred while the vehicle was in motion.” Vasquez was appeared to laugh or smirk during moments when she was looking towards her knee, the report added.

Police didn’t just note the number of instances her eyes were off the road, they also focused on the aggregate amount of time that Vasquez was apparently distracted. “The vehicle was in motion for 21 minutes, 48 seconds. Of that time, the total amount of time the driver’s eyes were averted from the roadway was 6 minutes, 47.2 seconds, or approximately 32% of the time,” police found.

However, Vasquez did call 911 after the crash occurred. She also passed a field sobriety test. Approximately half an hour into the test, the officer administering it reassured Vasquez that she was unlikely to face criminal charges, according to the officer’s bodycam video.

Vasquez was alone in the vehicle the night of the collision—a standard practice for Uber’s autonomous vehicle operators. Several other autonomous vehicle companies have opted to have two operators in their cars while testing. This was Uber’s practice when it started testing, CityLab reported, but the company switched to single operators in late 2017. An Uber spokesperson told CityLab at the time that the second operator had been present strictly to take notes and was not expected to maintain safety.

However, a co-driver might have noticed Herzberg walking into the road. In bodycam footage following the crash, an officer who spoke to Vasquez asked about the two-person policy. “Did you have a passenger? Because I know sometimes you guys ride two people together,” the officer asks.

In a preliminary report released late last month, the National Transportation Safety Board found that Uber’s vehicle detected Herzberg a mere six seconds before the crash, and initiated emergency braking 1.3 seconds before impact. Uber’s system is not designed to alert the operator of a potential hazard, the NTSB report found. The NTSB’s investigation into the crash is ongoing and its final report has yet to be released.

Update 10:30am, June 22: Added statement on the police report from an Uber spokesperson.

Correction: A previous version of this story mistakenly stated that Uber did not train operators about vehicle takeover; that section of the police report refers to instructions provided by the vehicle itself rather than a training manual.
