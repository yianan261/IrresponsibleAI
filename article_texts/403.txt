Google’s black box algorithm controls which political emails land in your main inbox. For 2020 presidential candidates, the differences are stark. By Adrianne Jeffries , Leon Yin , and Surya Mattu

Pete Buttigieg is leading at 63 percent. Andrew Yang came in second at 46 percent. And Elizabeth Warren looks like she’s in trouble with 0 percent.

These aren’t poll numbers for the U.S. 2020 Democratic presidential contest. Instead, they reflect which candidates were able to consistently land in Gmail’s primary inbox in a simple test.

The Markup set up a new Gmail account to find out how the company filters political email from candidates, think tanks, advocacy groups, and nonprofits.

We found that few of the emails we’d signed up to receive—11 percent—made it to the primary inbox, the first one a user sees when opening Gmail and the one the company says is “for the mail you really, really want.”

Half of all emails landed in a tab called “promotions,” which Gmail says is for “deals, offers, and other marketing emails.” Gmail sent another 40 percent to spam.

For political causes and candidates, who get a significant amount of their donations through email, having their messages diverted into less-visible tabs or spam can have profound effects.

“The fact that Gmail has so much control over our democracy and what happens and who raises money is frightening,” said Kenneth Pennington, a consultant who worked on Beto O’Rourke’s digital campaign.

“It’s scary that if Gmail changes their algorithms,” he added, “they’d have the power to impact our election.”

It’s well known that Facebook and Twitter curate which posts people see through the news feed, highlighting some while others are scarcely shown. What’s received less attention is how email has also become an algorithmically curated and monetized platform—essentially another feed—and the effect that can have. Some nonprofits and political causes said inbox curation is reducing donations and petition signatures.

Google communications manager Katie Wattie said in an email that the categories “help users organize their email.”

“Mail classifications automatically adjust to match users’ preferences and actions,” she said. “Users really like the tab organization.”

Gmail enables the tabs by default, but they can be disabled. Wattie declined to say whether most users keep the tabs, but an email deliverability firm said about 34 percent of respondents to a 2016 survey said they use them.

The tabs also serve another purpose: ad inventory. While Gmail does not sell ads in the primary inbox, advertisers can pay for top placement in the social and promotions tabs in free accounts.

The pace of emails sent by each of them also varied. *Gabbard was added in November; Bloomberg and Steyer, in February. **We signed up to receive emails from Donaldjtrump.com but didn’t receive any.

Some fear that, as a result, Gmail has the same conflict of interest that exists on social networks: If the platforms make it too easy to reach people for free, no one will buy ads.

“The worry is that they want to basically turn Gmail into a Facebook-style news feed where you have to pay for placement in the inbox,” said Ryan Alexander, a Democratic digital consultant.

Wattie, the Google spokesperson, replied: “What you describe is not on our roadmap for Gmail.”

Gmail isn’t the only email provider offering sophisticated inbox curation. The premium $30-a-month email provider Superhuman sorts messages into “important” and “other,” while Microsoft’s Outlook sorts messages for its “focused inbox.” Outlook and Yahoo also sell ads in their inboxes in free accounts.

But with 1.5 billion active email addresses and an estimated 27.8 percent market share, Gmail’s increasingly algorithmic inbox sorting has an outsized impact.

Nida Hasan, the director of Change.org in India, said she discovered in the spring of 2018 that the percentage of Gmail users opening her company’s emails had suddenly plummeted around the world, stalling petitions. In India, 90 percent of Change.org’s users are on Gmail, she said.

“There were a lot of really good campaigns which could not be mobilized or were stuck at a couple thousand signatures,” Hasan said.

Employees tested their own Gmail accounts and found that Gmail was sending Change.org emails to the promotions tab—even “forgot password” messages were winding up there.

A coalition of eight progressive advocacy groups in the U.S. noticed a similar change at about the same time and said it suppressed donations and petition signatures. We reviewed email data provided by Democracy for America, CREDO Action and SumOfUs and found their Gmail open rates did drop that spring, by about 50 percent compared with email sent to subscribers using other email providers.

“We believe that our ability to inform and engage the public in political action, which we believe is fundamental to a healthy democracy, is being impeded,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Google in November 2018.

During a phone conversation the following month, a Gmail official offered them a suggestion to get more eyeballs on their emails: “You’re not precluded from buying an ad in the promotions tab, or offering a deal,” said Lee Carosi Dunn, who at the time led election sales, political outreach and policy for Google, according to notes taken by one person on the call. “Your type of users may be looking for deals too, some deal that involves fund-raising or engagement.”

“We were appalled to hear that,” said Robert Cruickshank, campaign director at Demand Progress, who was on the call. “We don’t want to sound like marketing, because we’re not marketers. We’re asking people to call Congress.”

Wattie, the Google spokesperson, did not respond directly to questions about the call but rather wrote in an email that Gmail has not allowed “political content” in ads since 2016 and that those would include issue advocacy and fund-raising.

To test how Gmail treats political email, we opened a new Gmail account using a new phone number and Tor, an anonymizing browser, to avoid sending signals about political leanings based on previous web activity. Google says Gmail categorization is personalized, meaning user activity can affect where an individual’s emails are delivered.

We signed up for the email lists of 16 presidential candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. President Donald Trump’s campaign never sent us any emails.

We also signed up for congressional candidates in competitive races, and advocacy groups, think tanks, and nonprofits from across the political spectrum.

In four months, we received more than 5,000 emails from 171 groups. Much of the email sought donations. Some senders were unrelenting—at times sending more than one email a day. Nearly half of all groups and campaigns never got a single email into the primary inbox.

Presidential candidates’ emails were less likely to end up in the primary inbox than the rest of the email we signed up for: Only 6 percent of presidential candidates’ emails appeared there compared with 9 percent of other political and advocacy mail, on average.

When O’Rourke announced the end of his campaign, Gmail sent the message to spam.

Most often, presidential candidates’ emails wound up in the promotions tab in our test—90 percent of the time for some of them. Pennington, the consultant who worked on O’Rourke’s digital campaign, said the campaign’s internal data showed a lower spam rate than we found in our test.

“We are aware that emails go to Gmail’s promotions tab and we are not concerned about our ability to communicate with supporters,” said an email from Mike Casca, Bernie Sanders’s communications director.

Former campaign workers for O’Rourke, Yang, Kamala Harris and Joe Walsh also said they aren’t concerned about emails going to the promotions tab. Other candidates didn’t respond to requests for comment or couldn’t be reached.

Even emails sent by members of Congress through official House.gov addresses, which by law cannot be used for campaigning, were diverted to the promotions tab 25 percent of the time.

In marketing materials, Gmail gives straightforward examples of what kinds of emails belong in the promotions tab: “50% off Kayaking Adventure,” “$20 Off Membership,” “7 Must-Try Romantic Restaurants.”

But in our tests, the distinctions between emails that wound up in the folder and those that went to the primary inbox were less consistent.

An email with the subject line “NEW! Hoodies, sweatshirts, beanies” from BernieStore2020 went to promotions, but another announcing “So many new T-shirts! Grab yours today” from Yang2020 Merch went to the primary inbox.

A heartfelt obituary for senior fellow Michael Martin Uhlmann from the conservative think tank Claremont Institute, which did not include any calls to action, went to promotions. So did signup confirmation emails for the Texas Young Republicans and New York Young Republican Club.

Some political organizers and advocates say they are frustrated by Gmail’s categorization and questioned what political emails have to do with sales, as the “promotions” name implies.

Gavin Wax, president of the New York Young Republican Club, put it this way: “It’s just a step up above spam.”. Google’s black box algorithm controls which political emails land in your main inbox. For 2020 presidential candidates, the differences are stark.

In early 2018, several advocacy groups noticed a drop in open rates for subscribers with Gmail domains. They said this had a negative impact on calls to action and donations.

Using data sent to us by three of these advocacy groups as well as Change.org, a for-profit company that hosts petitions for political causes, we confirmed there was a lasting decrease in open rates unique to subscribers using Gmail.

↩︎ link Ratio Gmail to Non-Gmail Open Rates from January 2017 to March 2019 Change.org CREDO Democracy For America SumOfUS Gmail : Non-Gmail Open Rates 0.5 1 1.5 2 Open rates in Gmail dropped by at least 47% compared to non-Gmail subscribers' rates in this period Jan 2017 Jul 2017 Jan 2018 Jul 2018 Jan 2019 Date

Throughout 2017, all the organizations in the chart above had significantly higher email open rates for the Gmail subscribers than those that used other providers. Gmail open rates for Change.org (represented by the red trend line above) were, on average, 66 percent higher compared to those of non-Gmail subscribers. Between January and May 2018 (the blue rectangle in the graph), open rates for Gmail subscribers across all four organizations dropped by at least 47 percent compared to open rates for non-Gmail subscribers. Change.org experienced the greatest drop, 79 percent.

After May 2018, the ratio of Gmail to non-Gmail open rates mostly sat below 1.0 for the advocacy organizations. (We do not have data for CREDO Action past May 2018.) This signifies higher open rates for non-Gmail subscribers than Gmail subscribers. We agreed not to share raw open rates publicly, but we looked at them, and there was not a statistically significant increase in open rates for non-Gmail users between January and May 2018 for any of the four groups we analyzed.

View our work Data and code on GitHub

In interviews, the advocacy groups we spoke to suspected that the plunge in open rates was due to a change in Gmail’s automated mailroom that was placing their emails in the “promotions” inbox rather than users’ primary inbox. The promotions inbox is one of five algorithmically labeled tabs added to Gmail in 2013.

To begin to understand how Gmail classifies and sorts political emails, we designed an experiment with a new email address. We subscribed to receive emails from more than 200 political groups: from presidential candidates, House representatives approaching reelection in battleground states, think tanks, and advocacy organizations that either organized or supported political issues. Not everyone sent us emails.

After four months of data collection, we analyzed 5,134 emails from 171 groups and politicians.

↩︎ link Key Takeaways

Across the political spectrum, Gmail diverted nearly 90 percent of political emails from the primary inbox in our experiment. Most went to the “promotions” folder (50 percent), a feature enabled by default, or the spam folder (40 percent). About 11 percent of all emails were delivered to the primary inbox.

the “promotions” folder (50 percent), a feature enabled by default, or the spam folder (40 percent). About 11 percent of all emails were delivered to the primary inbox. Gmail blocked almost half of the political senders in our sample from the primary inbox entirely—42 percent of senders failed to get a single email into the primary inbox. (This statistic excludes senders with fewer than two emails in our sample.)

Gmail categorized presidential candidates’ emails as promotions 64 percent of the time, which is more than it did for other categories of political email. It sent more than 90 percent of Bernie Sanders’s and Amy Klobuchar’s emails to promotions.

Gmail directed less than one percent of campaign emails from House of Representative incumbents in battleground states to the primary inbox.

There were some outliers: Gmail’s algorithm sent the majority of emails from some senders, including the American Enterprise Institute (99 percent), Democratic Socialists of America (75 percent), and Pete Buttigieg (63 percent), into the primary inbox.

Our findings are based on a four-month study of one model email address and a list of political candidates, advocacy groups and think tanks that was robust but by no means exhaustive.

Our data show how Gmail handled one particular inbox with no user input; it’s how the default algorithm worked in this case without individual user participation.

Gmail says its algorithms respond to each user’s interactions to adjust categorization in the aggregate and for individual users. If so, email categorization will vary from person to person. It’s unclear to what extent this behavior would affect the categorization of political mail for any given person, but it’s important to note that our findings would not necessarily match where emails end up for a particular Gmail user.

We did not determine why Gmail categorized certain emails or certain senders’ emails the way that it did.

Gmail does not have an explicit label in the email metadata for the primary inbox. To estimate the emails that wound up in the primary inbox, we subtracted emails that went to other default tabs (promotions and social) and spam.

Gmail also labels emails with sorting for other tabs it offers, such as “updates,” but we did not analyze those categories because those tabs are turned off by default. Separating those emails would have further reduced the number of emails in the primary inbox—by 540 emails for the “updates” tab alone.

Organizations and campaigns send email from different addresses and domains, so we used a distinct tracking alias for each group and campaign (i.e., email+dnc@gmail.com) to identify the sender. All emails sent to that address were attributed to that sender. As a result, some emails may have been attributed to a sender incorrectly due to sharing or selling of email subscriber lists.

To discern how often that might happen, we checked a sample, 400 emails (100 from each sender category), and found only four of them, one percent, were from another sender. Of those, two emails that we attributed to End the Border Crisis Now were instead sent by Chip Roy, who funds that website. The other two emails that came from a sender other than the alias were from the TJ Cox campaign. They were sent to the email address we had set up for Harley Rouda’s campaign. It appears that Rouda shared his subscriber list with others.

When we checked all the presidential candidate emails, the only mislabeled email was one from the GOP that used an alias we’d created for Trump events.

Of the 231 campaigns and groups we subscribed to, 60 did not send us any email, including, notably, DonaldJTrump.com.

↩︎ link Data Collection

We created a Gmail account using a new mobile number on Oct. 15, 2019. We used a new phone number to avoid having Google associate it with an existing Google user profile. Google disclosed to us that user activity influences email classification.

We used our new email address to subscribe to email communication from 231 entities: presidential candidates (N=17), House representatives in battleground states (N=141), and advocacy organizations and think tanks (N=73). The list of political advocacy groups and think tanks is neither comprehensive nor scientific, but we sought representation from organizations across the political spectrum. We made sure to include the groups that initially reported the drop in open rates in 2018 (CREDO Action, Democracy for America, SumOfUs, Color Of Change, Demand Progress, Courage Campaign, Presente.org, Social Security Works) as well as Change.org, which noticed the drop independently.

Some groups required a zip code for email sign-ups. In those cases, we used 33601—Tampa, Fla.

We created a custom email alias for each sign-up, such as email+dnc@gmail.com, for bookkeeping. This was essential for tracing the emails we received back to the initial entities we shared it with. The complete list of the email senders we subscribed to can be found in the appendix. We did not receive emails from every group.

We collected 5,417 emails in our inbox from Oct. 16, 2019 to Feb. 12, 2020, from 171 out of 231 of the entities we signed up for. During this time frame, we periodically exported the inbox to an mbox file in Google takeout. Mbox is a standardized format of storing an email inbox as a single semi-structured text file. Regular exports were essential, as emails labeled by Gmail as spam disappeared after 30 days.

We did not open, move, or label the emails in the inbox.

↩︎ link Data Preprocessing

We preprocessed the mbox files by extracting relevant metadata fields, filtering out 44 emails sent from Google and 235 emails from email addresses not in our study sample.

These 235 emails are from nonpolitical groups (like the Girl Scouts and Veterans Affairs) that we had subscribed to at the start of the experiment but have since removed from our study. They also include emails that were not sent to a tracking alias, which may have occurred because the email sign-up form rejected the alias or the sender removed the alias.

There were no emails in the trash or sent folders, which we would have removed from the study.

Our final dataset consisted of 5,134 emails.

↩︎ link How We Classified Emails

We referenced Gmail’s own email labels, found in the metadata field X-Gmail-Labels, to establish a set of classifications for the emails we received.

↩︎ link Email Category

Primary Inbox are emails that do not contain “category promotions,” “spam,” or “trash” in X-Gmail-Labels.

Promotions are those labeled by Gmail as category promotions in X-Gmail-Labels but not as spam. Although emails can receive both labels by Gmail, the presence of the spam label directs the email to the spam folder in the user interface. In our sample, 69.22 percent of the emails that Gmail labeled as spam were also labeled as category promotions. We marked these emails as spam and not promotions.

Spam is any email labeled by Gmail as spam in X-Gmail-Labels.

We only analyzed data for email placement in spam and tabs that Gmail enables by default: primary, promotions, and social. Gmail offers another two tabs, but those must be activated by the user.

We used the following distinctions when deciding which entities to sign up for:

Overall, Gmail diverted almost all emails from the political groups and candidates we signed up to receive—89.37 percent—to promotions or spam. It delivered only 10.64 percent to the primary inbox. For many senders, Gmail did not send a single email to the primary inbox.

Of the entities with at least two emails in our sample, Gmail blocked nearly half of them from the primary inbox—41.61 percent didn’t get a single email into primary in our test. Gmail’s email classification varied from sender to sender and category to category.

This table shows variances in how Gmail treated email from different categories of political entities in our experiment. We collected data from Oct. 16, 2019, to Feb. 12, 2020.

For House campaigns, Gmail delivered less than one percent of emails to the primary inbox, diverting half the emails to promotions. Gmail treated House official emails differently, allowing almost half of those emails to the primary inbox—far more than other types of senders. Still, Gmail diverted one-fourth of the House official emails to promotions, even though “.gov” addresses cannot legally be used for campaigning.

Presidential candidates had the second lowest amount of emails sent to the primary inbox, 6.40 percent. Gmail sent fewer presidential candidates’ emails to spam than it did for other groups but sent the largest share to promotions, 63.81 percent.

Zooming in on each presidential candidate, two were outliers, with Gmail sending a high rate of their mail to the primary inbox: Pete Buttigieg and Andrew Yang, with 62.79 percent and 46.38 percent, respectively, far more than any other candidate. Gmail diverted less than 9 percent of their emails to promotions.

Compare this to Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Joe Walsh and Beto O’Rourke: Gmail directed none of their emails to the primary inbox in our experiment. Gmail categorized approximately 85 percent of Warren’s and Biden’s emails as promotions.

For Sanders and Klobuchar, Gmail sent more than 90 percent of their emails to the promotions tab—the most among presidential candidates. It delivered only 1.8 percent and 0.96 percent of their emails, respectively, to the primary inbox.

This table shows how Gmail categorized emails from each presidential candidate in our experiment. We collected data from Oct. 16, 2019, to Feb. 12, 2020, except for Gabbard, whose emails we started collecting Nov. 8, 2019; and Bloomberg and Steyer, whose emails were gathered from Feb. 6, 2020, to Feb. 12, 2020.

Although we subscribed to email updates on DonaldJTrump.com, we did not receive any emails from the Trump campaign. We also signed up for a Trump event and received one email sent from contact@action.gop.com, which landed in spam.

For the four groups that said they were harmed by decreases in their Gmail open rates starting in 2018, Gmail sent between 60.23 percent and 90.24 percent of their emails to promotions in our experiment. This was higher than the average for all advocacy groups and think tanks we signed up for, which was 46.38 percent.

For two of the groups, Gmail didn’t send any emails to the primary inbox in our experiment. One of these groups, CREDO Action, shut down in January 2020.

Just as some presidential candidates’ emails were outliers in how often Gmail sent them to the primary inbox, the same was true of some advocacy groups and think tanks, like the American Enterprise Institute, the Claremont Institute, and Democratic Socialists of America, at 98.86, 82.35, and 75 percent, respectively (see appendix).

In response to concerns that Gmail’s tabs and inbox ads would turn into a “Facebook-style news feed where you have to pay for placement,” Wattie replied: “What you describe is not on our roadmap for Gmail.”

The advocacy groups whose open rates for subscribers using Gmail dropped in 2018 said that, in a phone call that year, a Google representative suggested they buy ads in the promotions tab to improve their access to Gmail users.

Wattie did not respond directly to questions about the call but rather wrote in an email that Gmail has not allowed “political content” in ads since 2016 and that those would include issue advocacy and fund-raising.

We found that Gmail’s algorithm sent few emails from politicians and political groups to the primary inbox in our experiment. Half of political emails wound up in Gmail’s promotions tab, which the company says is for sales and marketing.

We also found that Gmail’s categorization of emails was uneven across organizations and politicians. For instance, Gmail did not send a single one of Warren’s 66 emails to the primary inbox in our experiment, yet it did send 63 percent of Buttigieg’s emails to the primary inbox, the highest-profile location in Gmail’s default tabbed inbox. What occurred to Warren is not out of the ordinary: For 42 percent of email senders with at least two emails in our sample, Gmail didn’t deliver a single one of their emails to the primary inbox.

We were unable to discern from the data we gathered why Gmail treated emails from different political entities differently. The company said its algorithm decides where to place emails based on individual and group behavior.

The spreadsheet of political entities we signed up for, their website, our email alias, as well as the category we assigned to them can be found here.
