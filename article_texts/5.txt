The use of robotic systems for some forms of surgery is still a relatively new area, but they have been in use long enough for researchers from MIT, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago to put together a set of findings on what they describe as "adverse events in robotic surgery."

As BBC News reports, their key finding is that the machines have been linked to 144 deaths and 1,391 injuries in the United States during the 14-year study period.

That translates to 1.4 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of the cases reported and, as the researchers note, is a relatively small number compared with the total number of robotic surgeries performed - between 2007 and 2013 alone, they note, there were some 1.7 million such procedures performed in the United States, over 1.5 million (86 percent) were performed in gynecology and urology, while the number of procedures in other surgical specialties was less than 250,000 (14 percent).

Still, the researchers say that "a nonnegligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures." Those issues, they explain, include things like broken pieces falling into the patient, electrical arcing causing burns, instruments not functioning as intended, and system restarts causing a delay in the surgical procedure.

As with any surgery, those risks can't be eliminated completely, but the researchers suggest that changes in the design and operation of robotic surgical systems "may reduce these preventable incidents in the future." Those improvements, they explain, could include things like "uniform standards for surgical team training, advanced human machine interfaces, improved accident investigation and reporting mechanisms, and safety-based design techniques."

Robotic surgery can reduce the risk of infections and help patients heal more quickly, proponents say. Surgical specialties for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower number of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9) procedures, they note.

ⓒ 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.. Robotic surgery is on the rise as doctors look to make procedures less invasive, but according to a new study, the strategy comes with risks.

Looking at more than 10,000 incident reports from the FDA spanning from 2000 to 2013, researchers found that robots were involved in 144 patient deaths and 1,391 patient injuries.

For most of the reports involving death, very little information was shared on why the patient died -- meaning it's difficult to say whether it was human error, a problem with the robot, or the risks inherent in surgery.

Still, the study's authors -- from MIT, Rush University Medical Center, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign -- found cause for alarm.

"Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery, a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures," the study said.

Some of the errors included burnt or broken pieces of tools falling into the patient (14.7 percent), electrical sparking (10.5 percent) and robots making unintended movements (8.6 percent) -- the last of which resulted in 52 injuries and two deaths.

And while robots did well during gynecology and urology procedures, there were more errors reported in complicated cardiothoracic and head and neck surgeries.

Overall, the study found 550 error reports per 100,000 surgical procedures involving robots, most of them not resulting in death or injury.. Robotic surgeries: Really safe?

A series of reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since 2000 were analyzed and it was found that robotic surgeries are not safe after all.

In recent years, the use of surgical robots in the medical community has increased, and surgeons have employed the assistance of machines during critical surgical procedures.

A report from MIT Technology Review found that patients had gone through over 1.7 million procedures in the U.S. that involved robots from 2007 to 2013.

Now, a study from researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Rush University Medical Center in Chicago found that these procedures are risky.

In a nutshell, the incident report stated that there were 144 deaths, 1,391 injuries, and 8,061 cases of device malfunctions that occurred during those aforementioned years.

Some of the reported cases sound so concerning. For instance, it was reported that there were instances when equipment sparked while doctors were performing a procedure. Such situations resulted in a total of 193 burned patients between 2000 and 2013.

Another incident report stated that broken pieces of the machine fell onto the bodies of the patients being operated. There were 100 cases of this kind, with one instance of death, as reported in Gizmodo.

Researchers said that death and injury cases for each procedure remained constant since 2007, according to a BBC report. But since the use of robotics in surgery is increasing, it would only mean that the number of events is also increasing each year.

Robot-assisted surgeries are usually costly, but they can offer several benefits. For instance, surgeons can use smaller tools that allow them to make more precise cuts.

This will mean that patients will heal faster, the risk of infection will be reduced, and fewer scars will be formed.

Furthermore, robots in surgery will also mean that not a lot of doctors should be present inside the operating room. This will make more of them available to tend to other cases.

Since there are risks associated with the machines, the study authors suggest that members of the surgical team should receive troubleshoot training so they will learn how to resume operation after an interruption.

The study has not compared rates of events to that of operations that did not employ robots. According to BBC, the study has not undergone peer review just yet.. All surgery carries risk, and that’s also true when it involves robots. A new study of U.S. Food and Drug Administration data reveals that a variety of malfunctions have been linked to 144 deaths during robotic surgery in the last 14 years.

In the study, researchers from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, MIT and Rush University Medical Center dive into record kept by the FDA. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database—known as MAUDE—contains mandatory and voluntary reports about incidents that have occurred. The researchers note that that, to date, “no comprehensive study of the safety and reliability of surgical robots has been performed.”

Some of the reported incidents sound a little... worrying. There’s descriptions of equipment arcing or sparking during procedures, which burned 193 patients in total between 2000 and 2013. Elsewhere, broken pieces fell into the bodies of patients in 100 cases, once killing the victim. And “uncontrolled movement” apparently injured 52 and killed 2 patients. The reports, however, don’t typically go into this level of detail—though over 60 percent were related to “malfunction.”



It’s worth noting that the number of deaths is small compared to the total number of procedures. The analysis shows that robotic surgery was related to 144 deaths between 2000 and 2013, but between 2007 and 2013 over 1.7 million robotic procedures were carried out. One thing the result does show, though, is that over the same period the number of deaths per procedure has remained relatively constant—suggesting that problems aren’t necessarily being ironed out.

Sadly, the study doesn’t compare the results to surgeries carried out without robots, which makes it hard to draw any real conclusions about the risks involved with robotic surgery. Still, the presence of the report, published on the arXiv servers, highlights the need for better reporting and analysis of robotic procedures. The authors agree: “Improved accident investigation and reporting mechanisms, and safety-based design techniques should be developed to reduce incident rates in the future,” they write.
