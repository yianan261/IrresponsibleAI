ARTICLE TITLE: Google Fined for Changing Shopping Algorithms in EU to Favor Own Service
Google's main argument, that changes to its algorithms were designed to improve the quality of its search service, was also rejected by the court. The judges held that "Google has not demonstrated efficiency gains linked to that practice that would counteract its negative effects on competition."

The outcome strengthens the hand of competition authorities across Europe to take a tougher approach not only toward Google's other specialized search services, including flights or restaurants, but also on similar ventures by other tech giants, such as Facebook's Marketplace or Apple Music.

“A great day for antitrust enforcers who want to deal seriously with anti-competitive conduct of digital platforms and have relied on this precedent,” Isabelle de Silva, a judge at France’s highest administrative court and until recently France’s competition chief, said on Twitter.

Luther Lowe, head of public policy at U.S. local-business recommendation website Yelp, urged follow-up actions against Google. “Rather than accept a Pyrrhic victory, the European Commission must now take this favorable precedent and prosecute Google for its parallel abuses in the local search market and allow services like Yelp to compete on the merits,” Lowe said.

It also paves the way for more damages cases as Google's rivals seek compensation. Vestager could insist that Google put in place a more effective mechanism to give shopping comparison rivals equal treatment.

Huge headaches

The threat of a flurry of new competition cases means a huge headache for the top management in Mountain View, Calif., which has had to deal with three fresh antitrust cases in the U.S. over the past year, on top of the expanding procedures in Europe.
