The Home Office is using an algorithm to determine whether a marriage should be investigated as a ‘sham’, according to documents obtained by the Public Law Project under the Freedom of Information Act.

PLP is concerned that this algorithm may be flawed and discriminatory because some nationalities seem more likely to be targeted for investigation than others.

Background

The UK has a detailed legal framework for targeting ‘sham marriages’: where couples get married to avoid immigration law, rather than because they have a genuine relationship. As part of this framework, registrars are required to refer proposed marriages to the Home Office if either or both of the parties is subject to immigration control.

Since at least April 2019, the Home Office has used an algorithm to triage these referrals. The algorithm gives each couple a ‘Red’ or ‘Green’ rating. ‘Red’ means that the Home Office should investigate the couple ‘to rule out or identify sham activity’, while ‘Green’ means that an investigation is not warranted. Media reports indicate that sham marriage investigations can be highly invasive.

The core elements of the Home Office’s algorithm are set out below:

PLP is concerned that this algorithm may be flawed and discriminatory. In particular, the Home Office’s documents show that some nationalities, including Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian and Albanian people, have their marriages rated ‘Red’ at a much higher rate than others. The Home Office has – so far – refused to disclose all of the ‘risk factors’ used by the algorithm to rate a case. The risks of discrimination in algorithmic decision-making are well-known. In August last year, the Home Office scrapped an algorithm it used to help decide visa applications, in the face of allegations that it was racially discriminatory.

PLP’s Research Team continues to investigate this algorithm, as part of our ongoing work on tracking automated government.

Newlyweds could be deported if flagged as suspicious by a new Home Office algorithm which lawyers warned could discriminate according to nationality and the age gap between partners.

A system designed to detect “sham marriages” divides couples into “red light” and “green light” categories, making an initial assessment over whether their partnerships are genuine or designed to get around visa rules.

It builds on earlier Home Office processes aimed at identifying fraudulent visa applications – but critics warned that inherent biases in those systems could affect genuine couples wanting to settle in Britain.

The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has established that an equality impact assessment (EIA) conducted by the Home Office revealed several issues with the “triage” process, including the possibility of “indirect discrimination” based on age.

And campaigners warned that its use of historic data leaves the process open to similar discrimination around nationality, echoing previous concerns about the systems used by the department as it developed a “hostile environment” regime.

The Home Office refused to release details of the eight criteria by which its computer programmes automatically flag concerns over whether marriage applications are genuine.

However, it disclosed that “red flags” are raised over the marriage applications from between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of couples where are least one partner is from Bulgaria, Greece, Romania or Albania. Those most frequently referred to the triage system include Albania, India, Pakistan and Romania.

A red light referral, which means the couple need to be investigated further, can put a person’s immigration and visa status at risk and could lead to legal action and deportation.

The system, outlined in an internal government document obtained by the Public Law Project, also takes into account the age gap between partners.

The EIAsaid: “There is potential for indirect discrimination based on age as the triage process uses the age difference between the couples.”

Nath Gbikpi, an immigration lawyer at Islington Law Centre, said. “There are quite clearly some clients whose marriage is more likely to be investigated than others.”

She added: “I wasn’t surprised to hear that there is an algorithm and I wasn’t surprised to hear that some nationalities are picked on more than others.”

Chai Patel, legal policy director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “Until there has been a full review of all systems and data, we can assume that any system the Home Office operates is not free from bias.”

The Home Office told the Bureau: “The purpose of the EIA as part of the triage system is to ensure we are able to identify any potential risk of discrimination and assess the impact. It is then considered whether the discrimination is justifiable to achieve the aims of the process.”

A spokesperson said: “Those who abuse marriage to enter the UK illegally will feel the full force of the law and it is right that we have a system in place to prevent this.

“Our triage system is not indirectly biased, and our Equality Impact Assessment is there to detect any possible bias while ensuring we are able to investigate and disrupt sham marriages effectively.

“Legislation introduced by the Government in 2014 has helped stopped sham marriages before they happen, resulting in fewer prosecutions.”

Last year the Home Office agreed to stop using a computer algorithm to help decide visa applications following accusations that it contained “entrenched racism”.



It backed down after it emerged that applicants’ nationality were included in the automatic system. The department said it was a “streamlining” system, but campaigners claimed it fast-tracked white applicants.
