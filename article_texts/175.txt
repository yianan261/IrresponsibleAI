Last week, a GM Cruise-converted Chevy Bolt without a driver was pulled over by San Francisco Police. In an unexpected turn, the car ‚Äúbolted‚Äù ‚Ä¶to a safe spot. Cruise responded below.

The original Instagram poster noted that this occurred in the Richmond District of San Francisco last week.

b.rad916: Confused SFPD pulling over an #autonomousvehicle in the Richmond District!! Then it tries to take off!! üòÜ üöî 1 week

GM‚Äôs Cruise vehicles have been operating autonomously in San Francisco at night, giving rides to employees around the city. Until now we‚Äôve only seen success stories. Recently, Google‚Äôs Waymo driverless vehicles joined Cruise in San Francisco.

Here‚Äôs Cruise discussing how the vehicles interact with police and emergency vehicles

There are some great takes in the Twitter feed:

I think the bigger deal here is that they didn't even get to rough anyone up. Will someone please think of the police for once ‚Äî Franklin Tabor (@TaborFranklin) April 10, 2022

Update: Cruise just responded:

We work closely with the SFPD on how to interact with our vehicles, including a dedicated phone number for them to call in situations like this. ‚Äî cruise (@Cruise) April 10, 2022

Electrek‚Äôs take:

Wow, this is quite interesting and it seems Cruise‚Äôs vehicle responded as intended though it is still uncertain why it was pulled over in the first place. From the video, it appears that the car could have been pulled over because of defective lighting, although that‚Äôs just a guess.

What do you think? Is this a victory for autonomous vehicles or something to be concerned about?. It‚Äôs been a little over two months since Cruise started letting the people of San Francisco catch rides on its driverless robotaxis, and one of its cars already had a run-in with police. In a video originally posted to Instagram last weekend, the user captures the awkward ‚Äî and somewhat comical ‚Äî interaction between the San Francisco Police Department and the autonomous vehicle after it‚Äôs pulled over for not having its lights on.

After stopping the Chevy Bolt-turned-Cruise vehicle, a police officer goes up to its window, tries to (unsuccessfully) open the door, and starts walking back to his cruiser. The autonomous vehicle begins to drive away in what at first seems like the perfect start to a police chase, but then pulls over and puts its hazards on at a point farther down the road. Police drive up behind the vehicle once again, get out of the car, and then hover around the vehicle as they presumably try to figure out how to turn its headlights back on.

As Cruise spokesperson Aaron Mclear explained to The Verge, the autonomous vehicle didn‚Äôt drive away to escape from police ‚Äî it was trying to find a safer location to pull over in, a move that most human drivers can‚Äôt get away with so easily. Mclear also confirmed that the SFPD pulled over the vehicle for not having its headlights on, and says Cruise has since fixed the issue.

‚ÄúThe vehicle yielded to the police car, then pulled over to the nearest safe location for the traffic stop,‚Äù Mclear said. ‚ÄúAn officer contacted Cruise personnel and no citation was issued. We work closely with the SFPD on how to interact with our vehicles and have a dedicated phone number for them to call in situations like this.‚Äù

An SFPD police report obtained by The Verge reflects Cruise‚Äôs statement:

On Friday, April 1, 2022, at approximately 10:00 pm officers observed a vehicle travelling without activated headlights at Clement St. and 8th Ave. Officers stopped behind the vehicle and discovered that there was no driver in the vehicle and no other occupant was present. During this contact officers affected a traffic stop. The vehicle moved forward but stopped again to yield for the officers. During the stop officers made contact with the remote operator of the driverless vehicle. Upon the officer‚Äôs notification a maintenance team responded to the vehicle‚Äôs location and took control of the vehicle. No citation was issued during the traffic stop.

Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, uses LIDAR technology to power its vehicles‚Äô self-driving capabilities. The company has been using the cars to shuttle around its San Francisco-based employees since 2017, but only just opened a waiting list to taxi the city‚Äôs general population.

We still don‚Äôt know what exactly caused the Cruise vehicle to operate without its headlights. Perhaps the car‚Äôs automatic headlights feature was disabled or failed to detect the darkness around it. Either way, it is a bit concerning. Cruise vehicles are only authorized to drive from 10PM to 6AM, which obviously makes headlights pretty important.

In 2018, a self-driving Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian walking her bike across the road in Tempe, Arizona. Subsequent investigations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that Uber turned off Volvo‚Äôs factory emergency braking system to prevent any interaction with Uber‚Äôs self-driving software, but it‚Äôs unclear whether that contributed to the crash.. A video which has gone viral shows a driverless car start to pull away after being stopped by police, at least initially - raising questions about how authorities can handle autonomous vehicles.

The car, owned and operated by a company called Cruise in San Francisco, is based on a Chevy Bolt chassis - although the company plans to launch a completely original vehicle soon.

After police pull over the car - for potentially not having its lights on, the video shows an officer walking up to the car door - appearing to be surprised to discover it has no driver - and then unsuccessfully attempting to open it.

After failing, he begins to walk back to his car, but the autonomous Cruise vehicle - which is allowed to drive at night in the city - zooms off in what initially looks like a getaway attempt.

However the car quickly turns its hazard lights on and then pulls in to a safer spot just down the road. The video shows the police following before stopping.

In a statement on Twitter the company said: "Our AV yielded to the police vehicle, then pulled over to the nearest safe location for the traffic stop, as intended. An officer contacted Cruise personnel and no citation was issued."

"We work closely with the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) on how to interact with our vehicles, including a dedicated phone number for them to call in situations like this," the company added.

SFPD has not issued a comment.

The trial in San Francisco comes ahead of completely self-driving cars being tested on the roads of the UK.

The Law Commission of England and Wales, and the Scottish Law Commission, want legal protections to be introduced for owners of self-driving cars if anything goes wrong with the automation.

However, whoever is in the driver's seat should still be responsible for things like insurance and children wearing seatbelts, the commissions said.

It is not clear how police in Britain could interact with a driverless car to ensure these forms of road safety compliance.

Two years ago a modified version of the Nissan LEAF completed the UK's longest autonomous car journey by driving itself the 230 miles from Cranfield in Bedfordshire to Nissan's manufacturing plant in Sunderland.

According to Nissan, the only times a human driver had to take over during the course of the journey was when the car had to drive into motorway services to be charged.

In April 2021 the Department for Transport announced hands-free driving in vehicles with lane-keeping technology would be allowed on congested motorways at speeds of up to 37mph.

Matthew Avery, chief research strategy officer at road safety organisation Thatcham Research, which consulted for the report, warned the transition to self-driving vehicles is "fraught with risk".

He said: "In the next 12 months, we're likely to see the first iterations of self-driving features on cars in the UK.

"It's significant that the Law Commission report highlights the driver's legal obligations and how they must understand that their vehicle is not yet fully self-driving.". . Since February, GM‚Äôs Cruise self-driving unit has offered public taxi rides in San Francisco. And for the most part, it seems the service hasn‚Äôt run into any notable problems. That is until a strange situation played out last weekend when one of the company‚Äôs vehicles left police seemingly confused by its response to a routine traffic stop.

The video you see above was first posted on April 2nd but only began to circulate widely after 9to5 publisher Seth Weintraub shared it on his personal Twitter account on Saturday. It shows San Francisco police attempting to pull over a driverless Cruise vehicle in the city‚Äôs Richmond District, only for the car to temporarily take off as a group of onlookers watch the scene in disbelief.

One day after Weintraub shared the video, Cruise commented on the clip, stating its vehicle yielded to police and moved to the nearest safe location for that traffic stop. ‚ÄúAn officer contacted Cruise personnel and no citation was issued,‚Äù the company said. ‚ÄúWe work closely with the SFPD on how to interact with our vehicles, including a dedicated phone number for them to call in situations like this.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear why police stopped the vehicle, but it would appear the car didn‚Äôt have its front lights on. It's safe to say we may see more episodes like the one that played out on April 2nd occur as autonomous vehicles become a more common sight on US roads. It should come as no surprise then Cruise produced a video designed to teach first responders how to approach its vehicles. Check it out above.
