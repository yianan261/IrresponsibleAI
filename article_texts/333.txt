Federal vehicle safety regulators in Michigan have launched an investigation into a new accident involving a Tesla Model Y electric vehicle that crashed into a stationary police car while driving in autopilot mode.

During the crash this Wednesday, a Tesla Model Y crashed into a blue Dodge Charger sedan. At that moment, the policeman stopped to record the accident of another vehicle, the driver of which hit a deer. The police car was parked with the emergency lights on, with part of it in the far right lane.

Officials said neither the officer nor the 22-year-old Tesla driver suffered any injuries. According to the officer, the driver reported that the car was moving in autopilot mode. The accident occurred in Eaton County, located about 100 miles northwest of Detroit.

The incident was just another in a series of accidents involving Tesla electric vehicles that drew criticism from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). At the same time, this is the second collision involving a Tesla car in Michigan in the last week. Prior to this, a Tesla electric car drove under a truck, while the passengers were badly injured.

Tesla has not yet commented on the situation.

Tesla and Samsung working together to develop a 5nm chip for autonomous driving

According to previous reports, the Tesla development team is working hard to develop a more sophisticated artificial intelligence framework. It will provide its vehicles with autonomous driving capabilities. South Korean Media Asia E reported that Samsung is currently developing a 5nm chip that provides computing power for Tesla’s self-driving cars. 5nm is the most cutting-edge standard we have in the market right now. It will dictate the path for the companies in the next years as 3nm may only become a reality by 2023. That said, just a few companies already have domain over the 5nm standard, and Samsung certainly is one of them.

Samsung currently provides 14nm chips for Tesla. Now, the companies are expanding their cooperation. The in-vehicle infotainment system uses a variety of chips such as processors, neural network processors (NPU), security integrated circuits, memory and display drive ICs (DDI). It is a core technology that processes information from sensors, lighting, and communications in the car and transmits it to the screen to enable the vehicle to achieve fully autonomous driving. As Tesla is planning to modernize its setup, Samsung is focusing its development in this direction.

Samsung believes that it has the ability to skip the research and development of 7nm chips. So it will immediately start research and development of 5nm chips for cars. If the company manages to successfully make this, the brand may find a supply agreement with Tesla.

This goes against certain rumors pointing to Tesla’s acquisition by Apple. Anyway, we have to wait for more details in this regard.. EATON COUNTY, MI – A Tesla on autopilot hit a Michigan State Police car early Wednesday morning, officials confirmed.

The MSP car was parked with its emergency lights on while investigating a car-deer crash at 1:12 a.m., March 17 on I-96 near Waverly Road in Eaton County, when the Tesla hit it, police said.

The Tesla was on autopilot and failed to move over, hitting the patrol car, police said.

The autopilot function means the car can “steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,” per Tesla’s website. It does not make the vehicle autonomous and requires supervision, per the website.

Federal agency to investigate Tesla-semi crash that left 2 critically injured

The 22-year-old Lansing man in the Tesla was cited for failure to move over and driving while license suspended.

No one was injured in the crash, police said.

Jackson County communities receive $450K from marijuana sales tax. A Tesla on autopilot mode crashed into a Michigan state trooper’s patrol car early Wednesday morning, according to a local report.

The car, driven by a 22-year-old man, hit the police vehicle in the Lansing area at about 1:10 a.m., as the trooper was responding to another car that struck a deer, WLNS-TV reported.

Nobody was injured in the crash. The Tesla driver was issued two citations for driving with a suspended license and failure to move over.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a team to Michigan to investigate.

It’s the second time in less than a week a Tesla has crashed in the state. In the first incident in Detroit, authorities have said it appears the driver was not using the car’s autopilot mode, according to WDIV-TV.

Tesla has said previously that its autopilot and “full self-driving” are driver-assistance systems and that the driver must be ready to intervene at all times.

The company has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for failing to adequately monitor drivers to make sure they are paying attention.

With Post wires. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating another Tesla crash in which Autopilot was allegedly in use.

The crash took place outside of Lansing, Michigan, when the driver of a Tesla Model Y smashed into a state trooper’s cruiser. Michigan police said the driver was using Autopilot, Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), at the time of the crash. No one was injured, but the government sent investigators to the scene to determine how Autopilot may have contributed to the crash.

“NHTSA is aware of the incident involving a Tesla vehicle near Lansing, Michigan,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “Consistent with NHTSA’s vigilant oversight and robust authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies, we have launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash.”

This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators

This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators. NHTSA has sent teams to inspect similar crashes involving Teslas that took place in recent weeks in Houston and Detroit. Local law enforcement has said it doesn’t believe Autopilot was involved in the Detroit crash, but they have yet to make the same determination in Houston.

This is also the latest incident to involve a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object. There have been at least two fatal crashes in which a Tesla owner has smashed into a stopped vehicle, and Tesla has yet to address it in any meaningful way.

Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. In the past, Tesla has warned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use.

At the same time, the company recently rolled out a beta version of Autopilot called “Full Self Driving” that has given many people the false impression that Tesla vehicles are autonomous and don’t require drivers to pay attention to the road. Tesla recently expanded the number of people who have access to the beta software. “Still be careful, but it’s getting mature,” CEO Elon Musk tweeted recently.

Tesla has a checkered history with the NHTSA, the federal agency that can issue recalls and investigate automobile crashes. The agency has investigated multiple fatal crashes involving Autopilot. Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the ADAS was one of the probable causes of a fatal 2018 crash, in which a California man was killed after his Model X smashed into a concrete barrier. Later, the chair of the safety board said Tesla was ignoring its recommendations. And last year, a spokesperson for NHTSA said the agency was “monitoring” the rollout of Tesla’s Full Self Driving software.
