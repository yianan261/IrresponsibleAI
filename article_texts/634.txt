CNN —

A finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into paying out $25 million to fraudsters using deepfake technology to pose as the company’s chief financial officer in a video conference call, according to Hong Kong police.

The elaborate scam saw the worker duped into attending a video call with what he thought were several other members of staff, but all of whom were in fact deepfake recreations, Hong Kong police said at a briefing on Friday.

“(In the) multi-person video conference, it turns out that everyone [he saw] was fake,” senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching told the city’s public broadcaster RTHK.

Chan said the worker had grown suspicious after he received a message that was purportedly from the company’s UK-based chief financial officer. Initially, the worker suspected it was a phishing email, as it talked of the need for a secret transaction to be carried out.

However, the worker put aside his early doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized, Chan said.

Believing everyone else on the call was real, the worker agreed to remit a total of $200 million Hong Kong dollars – about $25.6 million, the police officer added.

The case is one of several recent episodes in which fraudsters are believed to have used deepfake technology to modify publicly available video and other footage to cheat people out of money.

At the press briefing Friday, Hong Kong police said they had made six arrests in connection with such scams.

Chan said that eight stolen Hong Kong identity cards – all of which had been reported as lost by their owners – were used to make 90 loan applications and 54 bank account registrations between July and September last year.

On at least 20 occasions, AI deepfakes had been used to trick facial recognition programs by imitating the people pictured on the identity cards, according to police.

The scam involving the fake CFO was only discovered when the employee later checked with the corporation’s head office.

Hong Kong police did not reveal the name or details of the company or the worker.

Authorities across the world are growing increasingly concerned at the sophistication of deepfake technology and the nefarious uses it can be put to.

At the end of January, pornographic, AI-generated images of the American pop star Taylor Swift spread across social media, underscoring the damaging potential posed by artificial intelligence technology.

The photos - which show the singer in sexually suggestive and explicit positions - were viewed tens of millions of times before being removed from social platforms..

A multinational company’s Hong Kong branch faced a substantial financial setback due to an advanced deepfake scam. During a video call, an employee was deceived by digitally manipulated versions of the company’s CFO and others, resulting in the unauthorized transfer of funds to the scammers.

The scam recalls the August 2022 incident in which scammers created a Deepfake AI hologram of Patrick Hillmann, Binance’s Chief Communications Officer. The hologram was manipulated to deceive users into participating in online meetings and to target crypto projects of Binance clients.

Reports indicate that the employee was tricked into paying out HK$200 million (approximately US$25.6 million) after participating in a deepfake video call impersonating the company’s CFO. The worker was persuaded after seeing multiple staff members attending that call. However, all were deepfake recreations.

The worker initially became suspicious after receiving a message from the UK-based CFO and avoided it believing it was a phishing email. However, after a video call, the worker realized that the other attendees resembled his colleagues, despite initial doubts, as they appeared and sounded familiar.

What happened is that the scammers used publicly available footage to create convincing versions of the meeting’s participants, according to Hong Kong police senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching’s briefing on Friday.

In the digitally altered video, the CFO issued fraudulent instructions to transfer funds to unauthorized accounts. The employee, a finance worker at the company, followed the instructions, leading to a significant financial loss because the scammers had immaculately replicated the CFO’s appearance and voice.

The worker transferred $25 million to five bank accounts in 15 transactions. The scam was discovered after the employee shared the information with the company’s head office. It is worth noting that the incident lasted a week.

However, this isn’t the first of its kind incident involving deepfake technology. Fraudsters have been relying on this technology to cheat people out of money.

Bitdefender’s latest research reveals a rise in YouTube stream-jacking campaigns using deepfake videos for cryptocurrency theft. Despite McAfee’s MockingBird tool detecting 90% of deepfake content, scammers continue to use malicious techniques for crypto scams, sometimes bypassing facial recognition systems, highlighting ongoing challenges in combating these deceptive practices.

Authorities are investigating the incident in Hong Kong, which is the first such scam involving a large sum of lost money. It has raised concerns about the scammers’ increasing sophistication and potential for financial fraud. Experts urge increased awareness and training for employees to effectively identify and resist these scams.

Hong Kong police confirmed that eight stolen identity cards were used for 90 loan applications and 54 bank account registrations between July and September 2023 using AI deepfakes to trick facial recognition programs on at least 20 occasions. The authorities have so far arrested six individuals in connection with deepfake scams.
