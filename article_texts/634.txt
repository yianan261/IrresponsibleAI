Fraudsters used deepfake technology to arrange a bogus video conference call and elaborately trick a finance worker at a multinational firm into paying out $25 million.

The name of the Hong Kong branch of this multinational company is not specified by the police. But, according to the South China Morning Post, an employee of the firm was fooled after seeing digitally recreated versions of the company's chief financial officer and others in a video call.

At a briefing, Hong Kong police said the unnamed male employee thought that the people on the conference call were real when in fact they were convincing digital replicas. Finally, he paid out approximately $25 million to the scammers.

At first, though, the worker was suspicious. When he received a message allegedly sent by the company’s UK-based chief financial officer, he suspected it was a phishing email. But he cast away any doubts after joining the conference call and recognizing his colleagues.

And when the scammers then gave the employee orders to transfer the money to five separate Hong Kong bank accounts, he agreed to do 15 transfers totalling $25 million. The scam was only discovered when the employee later checked with the company’s head office, the SCMP said.

Deepfake technology was used to turn publicly available video and other footage of staff members into convincing meeting participants. The entire episode lasted a week.

The case is one of several recent episodes in which fraudsters are believed to have used deepfake technology to modify publicly available video and other footage to cheat people out of money. Hong Kong police said they had made six arrests in connection with such scams.

Most scammers use the technology to make loan applications and bank account registrations in one-on-one video calls but this case is the first of its kind in Hong Kong which also involved a large amount of money.

This sort of fraud might only get worse. For instance, a deepfake of Jennifer Aniston promoting a “MacBook giveaway” recently went viral on YouTube, and the likeness of Taylor Swift was also used earlier this month to promote a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway on Facebook and TikTok.

Fake sexually explicit images of Swift spread recently on social media as well, highlighting the growing problem of non-consensual deepfake pornography online.

A group of US senators have now introduced the Disrupt Explicit Forged Images and Non-Consensual Edits (DEFIANCE) Act, legislation that would “hold accountable those responsible for the proliferation of nonconsensual, sexually-explicit deepfake images and videos.”

Creators of such images would be subject to civil action lawsuits over digital forgery and entitle the victim with financial damages as relief.

Subscribe to our newsletter. A multinational company’s Hong Kong office was the victim of an elaborate scam using deepfake video technology to impersonate executives and scam the company out of HK$200 million ($25.6 million), local police reported on Sunday (Jan 4).

In what police described as the first scam of its kind in Hong Kong, scammers used deepfake technology to digitally recreate company executives and impersonate them on a video conference call. The technology allowed the scammers to generate fake but convincing representations of targeted individuals that replicated their voices and appearances.

The scam began in mid-January when an employee in the Hong Kong branch’s finance department received a phishing message, seemingly from the company’s UK-based chief financial officer, reports the South China Moring Post. The message claimed a secret transaction had to be conducted. Although initially doubtful, the employee was convinced after being invited to a video call in which the CFO and other familiar employees appeared to be present.

Except, of course, it wasn’t actually the CFO on the call.

‘Everyone is fake’

According to Acting Senior Superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching, not only did the virtual recreations of each participant look and sound like their real-life counterparts, they were even able to interact to some degree on the call by giving orders. However, if questioned more deeply, it’s believed their impersonations would have faltered.

“This time, in a multi-person video conference, it turns out that everyone you see is fake.” said Chan

He added: “They used deepfake technology to imitate the voice of their targets reading from a script”

The scam proceeded for about a week before the employee grew suspicious and checked with company headquarters. Police investigation revealed the meeting participants were digitally faked by scammers harvesting public footage of the executives and using deepfake technology to imitate their voices and likenesses reading from a script.

Local authorities did not reveal the name of the company caught in this scam.

To avoid falling victim to similar scams using deepfake technology, Supt. Chan advised asking the person to move their head or pose questions to check their authenticity. One should also immediately suspect foul play if money is requested during a call.

The sophistication of this nefarious technology is developing rapidly. Last week X was forced to block searches for popstar Taylor Swift after explicit AI-generated deepfake images of the pop star went viral.

An employee at a Hong Kong branch of a multinational firm was scammed into paying out 200 million HKD (more than $25 million) of company funds after a conference call in which every single participant — other than the worker — was a deepfake, the city’s public broadcaster reported.

Fraudsters, who are yet to be caught, used the company’s past meetings to create artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes of its chief financial officer (CFO) and several other employees to execute the elaborate scam, Radio Television Hong Kong reported on Sunday.

“In the past, we would assume these scams would only involve two people in one-on-one situations, but we can see from this case that fraudsters are able to use AI technology in online meetings,” Hong Kong police’s acting senior superintendent Baron Chan said.

“I believe the fraudster downloaded videos in advance and then used artificial intelligence to add fake voices to use in the video conference,” Chan was quoted as saying by RTHK.

Hong Kong police said the scam began last month, with the fraudster posing as the London-based firm’s chief financial officer and inviting the duped employee into a meeting with several of his co-workers.

On joining the meeting, the employee had a “moment of doubt” but fell for the scam because everyone on the call ‘looked and sounded real’, police said.

The scammers “used deepfake technology to imitate the voice of their targets reading from a script,” the South China Morning Post quoted Chan as saying. They “found publicly available video and audio of the impersonation targets via YouTube,” Chan said, according to CNN.

Following the meeting, the duped employee made 15 transactions amounting to HK$200 million within a week on the deepfake CFO’s instructions. The money was sent to five local bank accounts, auhtorities said.

The scammers also stayed in touch with the employee after the scam via WhatsApp, emails and one-on-one video calls, the SCMP said, adding that they also approached at least two other people at the branch using the same methods.

The employee — who was the only real person in that meeting — realised he had been scammed, during a call with the company’s head office later, police said.

Hong Kong newspaper The Standard said this was the first deepfake fraud involving such a large sum in the city.

A similar scam was reported in China last year, in which a tech worker was duped of $600,000 over a video call in which his “friend” asked for money to bid on a project.

Deepfake scams on the rise in Hong Kong

Deepfakes are realistic human faces — virtually undetectable to cybersecurity experts — generated using a technology called a generative adversarial network, or GAN.

Several AI tools and software, powered by the technology, have flooded the market, making it easy for anyone to create genuine-looking replicas of real people.

Deepfake videos available online are increasing 900% year-on-year, according to a recent KPMG report. “Deepfake-as-a-Service” opportunities have also imploded on the dark web, the report added.

Increasingly available AI tools have also made it possible to copy a person’s voice to make their deepfake uncannily believable.

In April last year, US-based Jennifer DeStefano reported receiving a telephone call with the voice of her 15-year-old daughter in a purported $1 million ransom call. DeStefano eventually discovered her daughter had not been kidnapped and testified about her ordeal in Congress in June.

Realistic deepfakes unfolded major controversy in the US again last month after explicit AI-generated images of pop star Taylor Swift flooded social media.

In Hong Kong, meanwhile, police say AI deepfakes were used at least 20 times for loan applications and bank account registrations between July and September last year.

Losses from technology-related crimes for the year were up 72% compared to 2022, amounting to 5.1 billion HKD ($652 million), they added.

A multinational company’s Hong Kong branch faced a substantial financial setback due to an advanced deepfake scam. During a video call, an employee was deceived by digitally manipulated versions of the company’s CFO and others, resulting in the unauthorized transfer of funds to the scammers.

The scam recalls the August 2022 incident in which scammers created a Deepfake AI hologram of Patrick Hillmann, Binance’s Chief Communications Officer. The hologram was manipulated to deceive users into participating in online meetings and to target crypto projects of Binance clients.

Reports indicate that the employee was tricked into paying out HK$200 million (approximately US$25.6 million) after participating in a deepfake video call impersonating the company’s CFO. The worker was persuaded after seeing multiple staff members attending that call. However, all were deepfake recreations.

The worker initially became suspicious after receiving a message from the UK-based CFO and avoided it believing it was a phishing email. However, after a video call, the worker realized that the other attendees resembled his colleagues, despite initial doubts, as they appeared and sounded familiar.

What happened is that the scammers used publicly available footage to create convincing versions of the meeting’s participants, according to Hong Kong police senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching’s briefing on Friday.

In the digitally altered video, the CFO issued fraudulent instructions to transfer funds to unauthorized accounts. The employee, a finance worker at the company, followed the instructions, leading to a significant financial loss because the scammers had immaculately replicated the CFO’s appearance and voice.

The worker transferred $25 million to five bank accounts in 15 transactions. The scam was discovered after the employee shared the information with the company’s head office. It is worth noting that the incident lasted a week.

However, this isn’t the first of its kind incident involving deepfake technology. Fraudsters have been relying on this technology to cheat people out of money.

Bitdefender’s latest research reveals a rise in YouTube stream-jacking campaigns using deepfake videos for cryptocurrency theft. Despite McAfee’s MockingBird tool detecting 90% of deepfake content, scammers continue to use malicious techniques for crypto scams, sometimes bypassing facial recognition systems, highlighting ongoing challenges in combating these deceptive practices.

Authorities are investigating the incident in Hong Kong, which is the first such scam involving a large sum of lost money. It has raised concerns about the scammers’ increasing sophistication and potential for financial fraud. Experts urge increased awareness and training for employees to effectively identify and resist these scams.

Hong Kong police confirmed that eight stolen identity cards were used for 90 loan applications and 54 bank account registrations between July and September 2023 using AI deepfakes to trick facial recognition programs on at least 20 occasions. The authorities have so far arrested six individuals in connection with deepfake scams.
