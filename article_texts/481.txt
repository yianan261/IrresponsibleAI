If you've been on TikTok lately, you might have been served a video advertisement featuring Joe Rogan and one of his guests on his immensely popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. In the clip, Rogan boasts about a "libido booster for men" supplement called Alpha Grind, going so far as to tell listeners exactly what to type in to find the product on Amazon.

Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters out there, with over ten million listeners per episode of his show. A brand endorsement like that would be a big get and likely a very expensive one for any product. Only Joe Rogan did not endorse Alpha Grind on his show. The clip featured in the TikTok video ad is a likely deepfake , an AI creation with the intent to make it appear as if Rogan endorsed the product in order to boost sales.

The video ad was posted and promoted on TikTok by a user going by the name @mikesmithtrainer. When Mashable first reviewed the TikTok account, the publicly posted videos consisted of testimonial clips of supposed everyday Alpha Grind consumers. As of publishing time, the @mikesmithtrainer account is no longer accessible on TikTok.

A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to Mashable that the company "removed these videos under our harmful misinformation policy." TikTok also banned the account.

On Twitter, user @JimmyFarley00 reposted the fake Joe Rogan clip and the tweet instantly went viral. The Twitter video has been viewed more than 5 million times and a number of users in the tweet's replies reportedly saw the ad on TikTok when it was still live. However, as of Feb. 15, the suspected Rogan deepfake has also been removed from Twitter. When trying to view the video, users are met with a prompt that claims the clip has been removed due to "a report from the copyright owner." Mashable has included an upload of the clip that is still live above.

When first confronted with the suspected deepfake Rogan video, some Twitter users didn't even realize what they were looking out for at first. Andrew D. Huberman, the guest on Rogan's podcast who is also featured in the video, entered the conversation to point out to those users that the conversation showcased in the video never actually happened.

"They created a false conversation," Huberman explained in the replies to the clip. "We were talking about something very different."

In the clip, it's clear that some parts of the conversation are lifted from the podcast. The video is heavily edited and takes bits and pieces from the actual episode. The clip then also weaves what is likely completely fabricated AI deepfake audio and footage of Rogan endorsing the Alpha Grind product during their conversation, which — pending analysis from an expert — would mean the hoaxer used machine learning to replicate Rogan's voice and paired that with deceptive video editing or additional AI fakery to match-up his facial features to what he's saying.

Deepfakes aren't new and have been worrying ethicists and disinformation experts for years now. However, there is a renewed interest in all things AI since OpenAI's impressive ChatGPT AI chatbot burst onto the scene showing just how much advancement has been made with machine learning technology.

TikTok actually banned deepfake videos on the platform back in 2020, however, it's unclear how much the policy is enforced. When Mashable reached out, a TikTok spokesperson highlighted the platforms Community Guidelines which disallow "Digital Forgeries (Synthetic Media or Manipulated Media) that mislead users by distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons, or society."

It should be noted that not all deepfakes are used for nefarious purposes, and that the technology can be used for creative videos meant to simply entertain viewers. However, deepfakes have been consistently thrust into the spotlight for their more negative use cases. Just last month, a popular Twitch streamer went viral after he mistakenly revealed in a livestream that he purchased non-consensual deepfake porn of other Twitch streamers.

Mashable has reached out to TikTok for more information on the Joe Rogan TikTok ad and the removal of the account that posted it. We will update this piece when we hear back.. TikTok removed a suspected deepfake video in which podcaster Joe Rogan appears to promote a male-marketed coffee product called Alpha Grind on his show.

A spokesperson for the social media site told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday that the video had been removed for "breaching [its] harmful misinformation policy, as per [its] Community Guidelines."

Harmful misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false, and TikTok instructs users not to post, upload, stream or share digital forgeries, including synthetic media or manipulated media, that mislead users by "distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons or society."

TikTok says it removes content that "causes significant harm to individuals, our community or the larger public regardless of intent." Significant harm does not include simply inaccurate information, myths or commercial or reputational harm.

TikTok told Mashable that the account that promoted the "libido booster" supplement was banned.

The video ad was posted and promoted on TikTok by a user called @mikesmithtrainer – an account that is no longer accessible on TikTok, according to the outlet.

Rogan and his guest, Stanford University associate professor Andrew D. Huberman, are seen in the video purportedly telling "The Joe Rogan Experience" listeners exactly what to search to find the product on Amazon. On Amazon, it says Alpha Grind, sold by the Delaware-based Top Shelf Grind Inc., is "viral on TikTok."

However, while bits and pieces are taken from the podcast, the video also weaves in fabrications.

"They created a false conversation," Huberman explained in the replies to the clip, which was reposted by a Twitter user. "We were talking about something very different."

The tweet went viral and was viewed millions of times before it was taken down.

"This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner," the post now reads. However, another upload of that clip remains live on Twitter.

Rogan has millions of subscribers and listeners and has recently tweeted about artificial intelligence.

Mashable notes that TikTok banned deepfake videos in 2020.
