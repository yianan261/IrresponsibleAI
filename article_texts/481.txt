Making realistic fake videos, often called deepfakes, once required elaborate software to put one person’s face onto another’s. But now, many of the tools to create them are available to everyday consumers — even on smartphone apps, and often for little to no money.

The new altered videos — mostly, so far, the work of meme-makers and marketers — have gone viral on social media sites like TikTok and Twitter. The content they produce, sometimes called cheapfakes by researchers, work by cloning celebrity voices, altering mouth movements to match alternative audio and writing persuasive dialogue.

The videos, and the accessible technology behind them, have some A.I. researchers fretting about their dangers, and have raised fresh concerns over whether social media companies are prepared to moderate the growing digital fakery.

Disinformation watchdogs are also steeling themselves for a wave of digital fakes that could deceive viewers or make it harder to know what is true or false online.. The thing about deepfake-impersonating a celebrity is that you can be almost anyone in the universe. You can be royalty! You can be a sex symbol! You can be a beloved dead actor brought back to life! So why do so many scammers, software developers, and Internet wise guys choose to be Joe Rogan?

AI startup Dessa started the ball rolling, developing software (in 2019!) that can make anyone look and sound like Rogan. Last year, another AI company released a podcast featuring a conversation between AI versions of Rogan and the previously dead Steve Jobs. Earlier this week, Cracked told you about comic Zach Silberberg using AI to fake ridiculous (and therefore eerily convincing) conversations between Rogan and Ben Shapiro. Canadians are dismayed about this phony dialogue between Rogan and Justin Trudeau.

This week, TikTok pulled down a fake video featuring “Rogan” shilling for Alpha Grind, a supposed libido booster for men. According to FakeRogan, it’s a supplement that can “really make a difference down there.” (The actual Alpha Grind product on Amazon is an instant coffee, albeit one with a Roganesque rundown of claimed health benefits.)

The implications of deepfake technology are alarming and potentially dangerous. But why is so much cutting-edge AI being devoted to impersonating the longtime host of Fear Factor? We have a few theories.

Theory 1: There’s so much Rogan to fake.

Rogan is a prime target for AI voice training, theorizes Ars Technica, because there is so much Rogan to choose from based on his hundreds of podcasts. AI needs material to sample, and few spew more words into the digital ether than the Here Comes the Boom costar. And the podcaster’s popularity likely plays into the equation--Rogan content has a way of going viral, even when it’s not really Rogan. "It's nice to sit back in the car and listen to you rant," says AI-generated Steve Jobs, proving that even dead geniuses are fans.

Theory 2: There is significant overlap in the Deepfake Scammer and Joe Rogan Listener populations.

Theory 3: Rogan has uploaded himself to Skynet.

Are we living in Terminator’s Skynet yet? If so, would anyone put it past the real Joe Rogan to hardwire his rants directly into the artificial general superintelligence system, if only as a means to promote Allform Customizable Sofas and MeUndies? We bow to our new digital overlords and thank them for the 20% off and free shipping when we use the code JOE.. TikTok removed a suspected deepfake video in which podcaster Joe Rogan appears to promote a male-marketed coffee product called Alpha Grind on his show.

A spokesperson for the social media site told Fox News Digital in an email on Thursday that the video had been removed for "breaching [its] harmful misinformation policy, as per [its] Community Guidelines."

Harmful misinformation is defined as content that is inaccurate or false, and TikTok instructs users not to post, upload, stream or share digital forgeries, including synthetic media or manipulated media, that mislead users by "distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons or society."

TikTok says it removes content that "causes significant harm to individuals, our community or the larger public regardless of intent." Significant harm does not include simply inaccurate information, myths or commercial or reputational harm.

TikTok told Mashable that the account that promoted the "libido booster" supplement was banned.

The video ad was posted and promoted on TikTok by a user called @mikesmithtrainer – an account that is no longer accessible on TikTok, according to the outlet.

Rogan and his guest, Stanford University associate professor Andrew D. Huberman, are seen in the video purportedly telling "The Joe Rogan Experience" listeners exactly what to search to find the product on Amazon. On Amazon, it says Alpha Grind, sold by the Delaware-based Top Shelf Grind Inc., is "viral on TikTok."

However, while bits and pieces are taken from the podcast, the video also weaves in fabrications.

"They created a false conversation," Huberman explained in the replies to the clip, which was reposted by a Twitter user. "We were talking about something very different."

The tweet went viral and was viewed millions of times before it was taken down.

"This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner," the post now reads. However, another upload of that clip remains live on Twitter.

Rogan has millions of subscribers and listeners and has recently tweeted about artificial intelligence.

Mashable notes that TikTok banned deepfake videos in 2020.

If you've been on TikTok lately, you might have been served a video advertisement featuring Joe Rogan and one of his guests on his immensely popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. In the clip, Rogan boasts about a "libido booster for men" supplement called Alpha Grind, going so far as to tell listeners exactly what to type in to find the product on Amazon.

Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters out there, with over ten million listeners per episode of his show. A brand endorsement like that would be a big get and likely a very expensive one for any product. Only Joe Rogan did not endorse Alpha Grind on his show. The clip featured in the TikTok video ad is a likely deepfake , an AI creation with the intent to make it appear as if Rogan endorsed the product in order to boost sales.

The video ad was posted and promoted on TikTok by a user going by the name @mikesmithtrainer. When Mashable first reviewed the TikTok account, the publicly posted videos consisted of testimonial clips of supposed everyday Alpha Grind consumers. As of publishing time, the @mikesmithtrainer account is no longer accessible on TikTok.

A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to Mashable that the company "removed these videos under our harmful misinformation policy." TikTok also banned the account.

On Twitter, user @JimmyFarley00 reposted the fake Joe Rogan clip and the tweet instantly went viral. The Twitter video has been viewed more than 5 million times and a number of users in the tweet's replies reportedly saw the ad on TikTok when it was still live. However, as of Feb. 15, the suspected Rogan deepfake has also been removed from Twitter. When trying to view the video, users are met with a prompt that claims the clip has been removed due to "a report from the copyright owner." Mashable has included an upload of the clip that is still live above.

When first confronted with the suspected deepfake Rogan video, some Twitter users didn't even realize what they were looking out for at first. Andrew D. Huberman, the guest on Rogan's podcast who is also featured in the video, entered the conversation to point out to those users that the conversation showcased in the video never actually happened.

"They created a false conversation," Huberman explained in the replies to the clip. "We were talking about something very different."

In the clip, it's clear that some parts of the conversation are lifted from the podcast. The video is heavily edited and takes bits and pieces from the actual episode. The clip then also weaves what is likely completely fabricated AI deepfake audio and footage of Rogan endorsing the Alpha Grind product during their conversation, which — pending analysis from an expert — would mean the hoaxer used machine learning to replicate Rogan's voice and paired that with deceptive video editing or additional AI fakery to match-up his facial features to what he's saying.

Deepfakes aren't new and have been worrying ethicists and disinformation experts for years now. However, there is a renewed interest in all things AI since OpenAI's impressive ChatGPT AI chatbot burst onto the scene showing just how much advancement has been made with machine learning technology.

TikTok actually banned deepfake videos on the platform back in 2020, however, it's unclear how much the policy is enforced. When Mashable reached out, a TikTok spokesperson highlighted the platforms Community Guidelines which disallow "Digital Forgeries (Synthetic Media or Manipulated Media) that mislead users by distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons, or society."

It should be noted that not all deepfakes are used for nefarious purposes, and that the technology can be used for creative videos meant to simply entertain viewers. However, deepfakes have been consistently thrust into the spotlight for their more negative use cases. Just last month, a popular Twitch streamer went viral after he mistakenly revealed in a livestream that he purchased non-consensual deepfake porn of other Twitch streamers.

Mashable has reached out to TikTok for more information on the Joe Rogan TikTok ad and the removal of the account that posted it. We will update this piece when we hear back.
