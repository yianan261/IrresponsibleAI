[Update 6/27]: In a statement from Delphi, the company has added further clarification and now claims that the two vehicles were never in any danger of colliding. The statement claims the original report from Reuters was incorrect, though the news agency has said it stands by its original report.

The most futuristic car crash in the history of humanity almost took place in Palo Alto, California, this week, when one of Google’s self-driving cars cut off another automated vehicle on a city street. Both cars were under the control of their respective computers, and they didn’t actually collide, but the close call marks a first as driverless vehicles increasingly expand beyond their limited test zones.

John Absmeier, the global business director for Delphi Automotive, was a passenger in his company’s automated vehicle prototype, a driverless Audi Q5, when it encountered one of Google’s self-driving Lexus SUVs.

Absmeier told Reuters that his vehicle was negotiating a lane change when the Google vehicle cut it off, causing the Audi to take “appropriate action” to avoid a crash.

The fact that no collision occurred is perhaps the most important takeaway from the story. Self-driving cars are appealing because of both convenience and safety. In this situation, two driverless vehicles running two different automated driving programs encountered each other in a potentially dangerous situation—one in which a human driver might have panicked—and both vehicles emerged unscathed.

Of course, the self-driving cars weren't able to give each other the finger after it happened.

Auto parts maker Delphi says that its experimental self-driving car was on a street in Silicon Valley earlier this week and was moving into another lane when an experimental self-driving car from Google cut it off by moving into the same lane.

Delphi disclosed the incident to a Reuters reporter earlier this week and confirmed it to CNNMoney Friday. Spokeswoman Kristen Kinley insists it wasn't truly a near miss but was instead an example about how self-driving cars effectively avoid accidents.

"Our car saw the Google car move into the same lane as our car was planning to move into, but upon detecting that the lane was no longer open it decided to terminate the move and wait until it was clear again," she said.

Google agreed with Delphi's take on the incident.

"The headline here is that two self-driving cars did what they were supposed to do in a fairly ordinary everyday driving scenario," said a spokeswoman.

Self-driving cars are allowed on streets and highways in California, but they are required to have a human driver sitting behind the steering wheel able to take over control of the car if there is a problem. The cars are not yet for sale to the public. The self-driving vehicles now on the roads are being used by companies that are developing the technology.

Self-driving cars are still rare, they're becoming more common on the streets near Google's Mountain View, Calif, headquarters. Google has 23 self-driving Lexus RX450h crossovers on the road, and recently put nine prototypes of its own self-driving car design on the road as well. Delphi, which recently drove a self-driving Audi across country, does most of its test drives near its autonomous driving lab, which is near to Google's headquarters.

Self-driving cars have been involved in a number of minor accidents with traditional driver cars during the last few years that they were being tested on the road. Google has driven the cars more than 1 million miles in autonomous driving mode. It says it has had 12 accidents. Most occurred when the autonomous driving car was stopped or nearly stopped and were struck from behind by a car with a driver.

There was a human driver sitting behind the wheel in all the cases, and in instances where the car was in motion when the accident occurred, the human driver took control of the car.. One of the main reasons behind Google’s commitment to driverless cars is their ability to avoid accidents and improve traffic safety , as they eliminate human error, which is the single most common cause of motor vehicle crashes. Up until a few weeks ago, the tech giant’s self-driving car prototypes had covered a total of 1.8 million miles without causing any accident, but their crash-free record was on a brink of being tarnished recently, with a report claiming that one of the cars almost hit another vehicle while being operated on a public road in California.

As reported by Reuters, one of Google’s driverless cars nearly collided with another car while driving in Silicon Valley, but an accident was avoided thanks to a timely maneuver performed by the tech company’s car. The fact that the other vehicle involved in this close encounter was also a self-driving car, makes the situation that much more intriguing. The other vehicle in question was an Audi Q5 crossover fitted with self-driving equipment developed by Delphi Automotive. Delphi’s vehicle was driving along a street in Palo Alto, when it started performing a maneuver to change lanes, but was cut off by Google’s car – a Lexus RX400h, and was forced to return to its lane and try to perform the lane change later.

Even though an accident was avoided, this close call got a lot of media attention, as it reveals that there is still a certain risk of autonomous vehicles getting involved in potentially dangerous traffic scenarios. On the other hand, it also shows that driverless cars are capable of detecting traffic situations that could jeopardize the safety of their occupants and other road users, and taking appropriate action to avoid them.

Delphi was quick to deny the reports of a near collision and explain that the reported incident actually reaffirms the ability of self-driving cars to avoid accidents. John Absmeier, director of Delphi’s Silicon Valley lab, was a passenger in the Audi Q5 when the incident took place, and later said that it wasn’t nearly as serious as media tried to portray it.

“The story was taken completely out of context when describing a type of complex driving scenario that can occur in the real world. Our expert provided an example of a lane change scenario that our car recently experienced which, coincidentally, was with one of the Google cars also on the road at that time. It wasn’t a ‘near miss’ as described in the Reuters story,” said Delphi in a statement.

In any case, no matter how harmless this incident was, it is bound to raise more concerns over whether autonomous cars are really able to operate on public roads without causing any accidents and without being a threat to public safety, and it might well have a negative impact on the public perception of self-driving cars.
