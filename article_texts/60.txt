Popular AI-powered selfie program FaceApp was forced to pull new filters that allowed users to modify their pictures to look like different races, just hours after it launched it.

The app, which initially became famous for its features that let users edit images to look older or younger, or add a smile, launched the new filters around midday on Wednesday. They allowed a user to edit their image to fit one of four categories: Caucasian, Asian, Indian or Black.

FaceApp's 'ethnicity filters' are a pretty terrible idea. Like, maybe one of the worst ideas. https://t.co/kV09pNpWRs — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) August 9, 2017

Users rapidly pointed out that the feature wasn’t particularly sensitively handled: technology site The Verge described it as “tantamount to a sort of digital blackface, ‘dressing up’ as different ethnicities”, while TechCruch said the app “seems to be getting a little too focused on races rather than faces”.

The company initially released a statement arguing that the “ethnicity change filters” were “designed to be equal in all aspects”.

“They don’t have any positive or negative connotations associated with them,” the company’s chief executive Yaroslav Goncharov said. “They are even represented by the same icon. In addition to that, the list of those filters is shuffled for every photo, so each user sees them in a different order.”

But by 5pm on the same day, FaceApp apparently agreed with the criticism, pulling the new filters from its app. They were unavailable to users a few hours later.

Wow... FaceApp really setting the bar for racist AR with its awful new update that includes Black, Indian and Asian "race filters" pic.twitter.com/Lo5kmLvoI9 — Lucas Matney (@lucasmtny) August 9, 2017

It’s not even the first time the app has waded into this storm. In April, it came under fire for its “hot” filter, which was supposed to make users look more attractive. In the process, it also lightened their complexion, leading to uncomfortable questions about what the AI had been taught about the nature of beauty.

It isn’t only small applications which make these blunders. Snapchat faced similar opprobrium for a filter which made users look like late reggae singer Bob Marley, replete with cartoon dreadlocks and a cap; whats more, the filter was released on 20 April 2016, a day (“4/20”) known for its association with weed culture – leading to accusations the company was cheapening Marley’s legacy.. A viral app that added Asian, Black, Caucasian and Indian filters to people's selfies has removed them after being accused of racism.

The update which launched yesterday was met with backlash - with many people criticising it for propagating racial stereotypes.

The filters drew comparison with 'blackface' and 'yellowface' - when white people wear make up to appear to be from a different ethnic group.

WHAT IS FACEAPP? The app uses Artificial Intelligence to transform faces. Filters users can choose from include: - Adding a smile - Changing your age - Becoming 'more attractive' - Changing gender The Russia-based company initially denied their new filters were racist but then added that they would be removed.

The Russia-based company initially denied their new filters were racist but then added that they would be removed.

On Wednesday CEO Yaroslav Goncharov said 'the new controversial filters will be removed in the next few hours.'

'Can't believe FaceApp added filters for different races. So offensive!', wrote Twitter user Ethan Booker.

'They don't have any positive or negative connotations associated with them', Mr Goncharov told TechCrunch.

'They are even represented by the same icon. In addition to that, the list of those filters is shuffled for every photo, so each user sees them in a different order,' he said.

The app has 40 million users across Android and iOS devices.

This isn't the first time FaceApp has offended users.

In April, the makers of FaceApp apologised after users claimed the 'hot' filter lightened their skin tone.

The app's creators claimed it would 'transform your face using Artificial Intelligence', allowing selfie-takers to alter their photos to look old or 'beautify' themselves.

But users have complained after they found that one beautifying option, labelled 'hot', lightens their skin tone.

'We are deeply sorry for this unquestionably serious issue,' wrote Mr Goncharov back in August.

'It is an unfortunate side-effect of the underlying neural network caused by the training set bias, not intended behaviour.

'To mitigate the issue, we have renamed the effect to exclude any positive connotation associated with it.'

Those who download the app found the 'hot' filter has been renamed 'spark'.

Another Twitter user, kung fu khary, wrote in April: 'So this app is apparently racist as hell. But at least I'm sassy.' The app appeared to make his skin lighter when using the 'hot' filter

Many users took to Twitter to complain about the app.

User Terrence AB Johnson wrote: '#faceapp isn't just bad it's also racist... [hot] filter=bleach my skin and make my nose your opinion of European. No thanks #uninstalled'.

IS MEITU RACIST? Earlier this year people accused the popular photo editing app Meitu of being racist. The free Chinese app has a 'hand-drawn' feature that can 'transform your photos into hand paintings,' according to the firm. This means it'll give you huge, sparkling eyes, smooth skin, and blushing cheeks. The feature comes with a number of different filters, including Angelic, Blossoms, Fairy Tale, Mermaid, and Petals. And some will make you look like something right out of anime. Some users claimed this feature gave them 'yellow face'. Advertisement

And user Haack the planet said: 'Nine year old son noticed the 'hot' filter on FaceApp just makes us look lighter. 'That's racist!' He yelled.'

FaceApp is not the first beautifying app to spark controversy over racism claims.

Earlier this year people accused the popular photo editing app Meitu of giving users 'yellow face'.

The free Chinese Meitu app is available for both Android and iPhone, and can be used for regular photo editing, like removing blemishes or even giving yourself a 'virtual facelift.'

But with the 'hand-drawn' feature users can 'transform your photos into hand paintings,' according to the firm.

This means it'll give you huge, sparkling eyes, smooth skin and blushing cheeks.

The feature comes with a number of different filters, including Angelic, Blossoms, Fairy Tale, Mermaid, and Petals.

User Haack the planet tweeted that even her nine-year-old son had spotted the app's apparent racism

And some will make you look like something right out of anime.

Some people saw the exaggerated features it gave users as racist and took to Twitter to complain.

User Vaughan posted a picture of Kanye West with a filter applied that made his skin lighter, along with the caption: 'So Meitu's pretty racist'.
