New Delhi: In connection with incident of Delhi Metro’s driverless train in Kalindikunj depot on December 19, DMRC Chief Dr. Mangu Singh approved orders for suspension of four officials connected held primarily responsible for the unexpected incident causing damage to metro property including a train, a shunter and workshop building infrastructure.

The four officials included one Deputy General Manager who was the In-charge of Kalindi Kunj depot, one Assistant Manager under him responsible for the depot activities and a Junior Engineer and Assistant Section Engineer who were involved in operating that train. The suspension is based on the enquiry done by a team of three Executive Director rank officers.

The incident report of the enquiry revealed that this incident was solely attributable to human failure as proper procedures were not followed. The train’s brakes, which were isolated (necessary for push/pull operations in the depot area when a train is required to move with a battery operated vehicle) were not normalized before moving the train on its own power and bringing it for washing at the ramp. As a result, as soon as the operator brought the train at the ramp, it started rolling back, got derailed and hit the wall.



“The incident was a localized incident within the maintenance shed of the depot. This part of the depot is for maintenance of trains and without power for trains. Trains are pulled by a shunter engine and therefore this area is not controlled by signaling system. Accordingly, the train was doing local shunting in this part with a person on board and was not ‘driverless’. Such an operation would would not affect the main line operations in any way whatsoever where public would be carried eventually.”, said in a press release issued by the DMRC.

“The incident was a cause of human error and concerned officers and staff have already been suspended.”, said Anuj Dayalm CPRO of DMRC.

On Tuesday afternoon, Delhi Metro’s driverless train rammed into a boundary wall after the authorities failed to check the brake systems. The incident took place at 3:40 pm at the Kalindi Kunj depot. Nobody was injured in the crash, but the pictures from the accident went viral on the internet. Soon after the accident, Twitter was bombarded with hilarious memes made out of the viral picture. Check them out.

PM Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the Kalkaji Mandir-Botanical Garden stretch of the Magenta Line, which will run between Delhi and Noida. The authorities have blamed the accident on human negligence and a high-level inquiry is ordered on the matter.

"A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall," the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement.

Ideally, the brake system of the train should’ve been tested before sending it for the trial. "It appears this was not done...the person who took charge of the train did not check the brake...Without the brakes, the train rolled back when it was being taken on a washing ramp," the statement said.

Delhi Metro's Managing Director Mangu Singh said operations on the Magenta Line were "absolutely safe", with a high level of automation. "Today's incident was manual error during maintenance and has nothing to do with the trials or passenger safety during future operations," said Mr Singh.. A driverless train going out of control and ending up where it absolutely should not be is the stuff of futuristic, 'robots-will-take-over' nightmares. And, that nightmare seemingly came alive yesterday in the National Capital Region (NCR) when a train of the new Magenta Line of the Delhi went off the rails and crashed into a boundary wall at the Kalindi Kunj carshed.

The kicker? The Magenta Line, which will connect Noida in Uttar Pradesh to south Delhi, will run driverless trains. Coming less than a week before the new route's inauguration on December 25 (by Prime Minister Narendra Modi), the accident was bound to create panic and scare even the most daring of commuters.

However, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was at pains to explain that the accident was NOT in any way a result of the trains being driverless. "Train movement inside the workshop area is done manually and is not operated through the [automated] signalling system. Therefore, such an incident taking place during passenger operations is NOT POSSIBLE," a Delhi Metro spokesperson said (emphasis original).

The managing director of the DMRC, Dr Mangu Singh reiterated the point and said the "main line operations on this [Magenta] line are absolutely safe, with a high level of automation and has (sic) been thoroughly checked and cleared by the commissioner of metro rail safety for passenger operations."

So what caused the accident in the first place? Well, human error, says Delhi Metro based on preliminary findings.

The accident at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot took place essentially because some staff forgot to check whether the train's braking system was active or not after it had undergone tests and checks inside the Kalindi Kunj workshop.

According to an incident report prepared by the Delhi Metro, the train's bakes were "decommissioned", as is routine, when it was brought into a shed for tests and checks. The braking system is decommissioned "as per normal procedure prescribed " so that all of the train's "systems including the brakes can be freely checked," the incident report reads.

"As per procedure, once the train is again re-commissioned, the brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff in the depot before the train left the shed," the report continues before adding that "prima facie, it appears, this was not done".

Staff who then took charge of the train also failed to check whether the braking system was active and took the rakes to the washing area. There the train went up a ramp and was supposed to stop, but since the brakes were inactive, the "train rolled back causing this incident."

A high-level inquiry into the incident is ongoing and the DMRC has said "Prima facie it appears, to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry."

The Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government, which has a running a feud with the Delhi Metro over ticket prices, has sought a report from the transport authority. "I have sought a report from DMRC on the derailment of its driverless train during trial run on Kalkaji-Botanical Garden. Shocking lapse ! There can be no compromise on passenger safety," Delhi transport minister Kailash Gehlot tweeted soon after the accident was reported.

The Magenta line will initially link the Botanical Garden station in Noida to Kalkaji Mandir in south Delhi. The line will later be expanded up to Janakpuri West. Botanical Garden will serve as an inter-change station, allowing commuters to switch between the Yellow and Magenta lines.. Delhi Metro accident today: On December 19, during the trial run of the Magenta line, one of the trains reportedly met with an accident as it tore through an iron grill at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit on December 25 to inaugurate Delhi Metro’s new Magenta Line which connects Delhi Metro’s Blue line to Violet Line, from Botanical Garden to Kalindi Kunj. As of now, there are no reports of casualties. The Magenta Line came as a breather for many commuters as it will reduce the distance between Noida and South Delhi to a mere 19-minute ride. Explaining the incident, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation issued a press release stating the reason behind the mishap.

In its press release, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident. The enquiry will have a committee of three Executive Directors: Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. The press release explains the entire incident.

An incident occurred at 3.40 PM (1540hrs) at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot today which is under commissioning. A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall. No person was injured in the incident.

As per normal procedure prescribed, when a train enters the workshop, the brakes of the train are decommissioned so that the train and its systems including the brakes can be freely checked. As per procedure, once the train is again re-commissioned, the brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff in the depot before the train left the shed. The train movement inside the workshop area is done manually and not by the signalling system.

Prima facie, it appears, this was not done and subsequently, the person who took charge of the train from the maintenance staff also did not check the brake and proceeded with the train up to the washing plant built on a ramp. While stopping at the ramp, since the brakes were not available, the train rolled back causing this incident.

MD, DMRC has ordered a high-level enquiry into this incident by a committee of three officers of the rank of Executive Directors consisting of Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (Project), Executive Director/ Rolling Stock (O&M), Executive Director/ Operations. Prima facie it appears, to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry.
