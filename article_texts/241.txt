ARTICLE TITLE: Chess-Playing Robot Broke Child's Finger in Russia
All assumptions that advanced AI will destroy humanity are wrong. Not the powerful AI or breaking laws of robotics will destroy mankind, but engineers with both left hands :/

A chess robot in Moscow has broken the finger of its human opponent
According to the organizers of the tournament in the Russian capital, it was an “accidental” attack by the robot. A seven-year-old boy named Christopher, who, by the way, according to them, is among the top 30 chess players in Moscow under the age of nine, moved a piece on the chessboard earlier than he should, which led to the non-standard behavior of the robot.

The AI ​​robotic arm grabbed the young player’s index finger and squeezed his finger firmly. The people around the boy immediately rushed to help, but did not prevent the consequences in the form of a broken finger.

Robots are advancing the technology of dealers not only in chess, but also in the world of online casinos. Among them, バカラ（Baccarat）, where the speed of the game is faster, is attracting attention as a more fair and accurate game with a robot facilitating the game. Robots are also a great solution for situations where only a limited number of dealers can be employed, or where there are no time or labor restrictions, and robots can always complement the “staff”.
“A robot broke a child’s finger – that’s bad, of course. We rented the robot, it used to be with experts in many places for a long time. Apparently the operators overlooked that. The child moved the figure, then the robot must be given time to react. But the boy was in a hurry and the robot grabbed him. We have nothing to do with the robot,” commented Moscow Chess Federation President Sergey Lazarev.

“The kid continued the tournament the next day, finished it in plaster,” Lazarev added, adding that the boy’s parents are now considering filing a lawsuit.

“You want to contact the prosecutor. We will contact them and help them to solve the situation. Robot operators should probably consider increasing security to prevent the situation from repeating itself in the future,” he concluded.
