While the literal translation of Mac Allister‚Äôs comment means ‚Äúlet‚Äôs f***‚Äù, the phrase itself has a different meaning. A more accurate translation to ‚ÄúVamos Carajo‚Äù would mean something along the lines of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs f***ing go‚Äù. Moreover, the phrase is usually followed up with a club or a team‚Äôs name in the middle. In the English translation, this would be added to the end of the sentence.
