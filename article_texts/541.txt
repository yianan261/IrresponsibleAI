. A US attorney is now “greatly regretting” his decision to trust OpenAI’s ChatGPT in a litigation process. Steven Schwartz will be charged in a New York court for using fake citations cooked up by the AI tool in legal research for a case he was handling.

In a sworn affidavit, Schwartz admitted to using ChatGPT to research for the case, representing his client Roberto Mata, to sue Colombian airline Avianca for injuries sustained onboard one of its planes in 2019.

Despite ChatGPT’s widely known warnings that it can sometimes produce incorrect information, Schwartz defended himself saying he was “unaware that its content could be false.”

Presiding judge Kevin Castel expressed his doubts over the authenticity of the cases the attorney presented. “Six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations,” Castel said.

The cases ChatGPT presented the lawyer in his research were Varghese v. China South Airlines, Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Shaboon v. EgyptAir, Petersen v. Iran Air, Miller v. United Airlines, and Estate of Durden v. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

These cases did not exist, Castel said in an order demanding an explanation for their citation by Mata’s legal team. They were found to be made up and had fake judicial wording. Even the quotes and internal citations were just make-believe.

Though Schwartz has vowed to never use AI in future to “supplement” his legal research “without absolute verification of its authenticity,” he now faces sanctions. A hearing on the matter is now scheduled for June 8.. Artificial intelligence could replace millions of jobs in the U.S.

A lawyer who relied on ChatGPT to prepare a court filing on behalf of a man suing an airline is now all too familiar with the artificial intelligence tool's shortcomings — including its propensity to invent facts.

Roberto Mata sued Colombian airline Avianca last year, alleging that a metal food and beverage cart injured his knee on a flight to Kennedy International Airport in New York. When Avianca asked a Manhattan judge to dismiss the lawsuit based on the statute of limitations, Mata's lawyer, Steven A. Schwartz, submitted a brief based on research done by ChatGPT, Schwartz, of the law firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman, said in an affidavit.

While ChatGPT can be useful to professionals in numerous industries, including the legal profession, it has proved itself to be both limited and unreliable. In this case, the AI invented court cases that didn't exist, and asserted that they were real.

The fabrications were revealed when Avianca's lawyers approached the case's judge, Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York, saying they couldn't locate the cases cited in Mata's lawyers' brief in legal databases.

The made-up decisions included cases titled Martinez v. Delta Air Lines, Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines and Varghese v. China Southern Airlines.

"It seemed clear when we didn't recognize any of the cases in their opposition brief that something was amiss," Avianca's lawyer Bart Banino, of Condon & Forsyth, told CBS MoneyWatch. "We figured it was some sort of chatbot of some kind."

Schwartz responded in an affidavit last week, saying he had "consulted" ChatGPT to "supplement" his legal research, and that the AI tool was "a source that has revealed itself to be unreliable." He added that it was the first time he'd used ChatGPT for work and "therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false."

He said he even pressed the AI to confirm that the cases it cited were real. ChatGPT confirmed it was. Schwartz then asked the AI for its source.

ChatGPT's response? "I apologize for the confusion earlier," it said. The AI then said the Varghese case could be located in the Westlaw and LexisNexis databases.

Judge Castel has set a hearing regarding the legal snafu for June 8 and has ordered Schwartz and the law firm Levidow, Levidow & Oberman to argue why they should not be sanctioned.

Levidow, Levidow & Oberman could not immediately be reached for comment.. Source? AI made it up.

ChatGPT's propensity to make stuff up strikes again — and this time, it's gotten a lawyer in deep trouble.

As described in an early May affidavit, an attorney representing a man suing an airline for an alleged injury admitted he used the AI chatbot to do research for his client's case. Which was why, in his legal brief, he cited a bunch of court cases — all with official-sounding names like "Martinez v. Delta Air Lines" and "Varghese v. China Southern Airlines" — that never actually happened, and hence do not exist.

The attorney, Steven Schwartz of Manhattan's Levidow, Levidow & Oberman law firm, told the court that it was the first time in his more than three-decade career that he'd used ChatGPT, so per the New York Times, "was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false."

Schwartz even told the judge, P. Kevin Castel, that he had asked ChatGPT to verify its sources. The chatbot apparently told him the cases were real, the NYT reports.

Yes, that's right. An experienced attorney used ChatGPT in court — and is now in huge trouble after it fabricated entire swathes of legal precedent.

Bogus

Schwartz told the court that he "greatly regrets" using ChatGPT to do his research for the case "and will never do so in the future without absolute verification of its authenticity."

Judge Castel, however, doesn't seem swayed, and in his May 4 order he in no uncertain terms described the gravity of the situation.

"The Court is presented with an unprecedented circumstance," reads the judge's order for a future hearing. "A submission filed by plaintiff’s counsel in opposition to a motion to dismiss is replete with citations to non-existent cases... six of the submitted cases appear to be bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations."

Next month, Castel will hold a hearing to discuss whether or not Schwartz should be sanctioned. But in the meantime, this bizarre case should hopefully act as a cautionary tale for lawyers — and everyone else — looking to experiment with ChatGPT in a professional setting.
