Three high school students just north of New York City posted videos on TikTok that appeared to show a nearby middle school principal and a member of law enforcement making virulently violent and racist remarks about Black students. The thing was, the videos weren’t real. They were deepfakes, videos that were significantly altered to appear like these individuals, and created by high school students from Carmel High School.

“I hope these n*****s get shot because they just don’t learn,” the video states. “I am bringing my machine gun to school. I’m going to Ronnie McNutt this bitch and all those n****s.” McNutt is the name of a man who went viral on Facebook in August 2020 for livestreaming his own death by suicide. “I hope these n*****s get shot because they just don’t learn,” the video states. “I am bringing my machine gun to school.

The videos, which were originally posted by the students from Carmel High School last month, were taken down and the school authorities condemned the “blatant racism.” However, most of the parents never saw the full videos before they were deleted and most were completely unaware of the specific and racist threats made against Black students. Some parents in recent days have publicly condemned the school authorities’ lack of actions, claiming that these videos are part of a wider problem of racist behavior in the district’s schools, and that law enforcement has failed to take the threats made in the videos seriously enough.

Schwartz says that the school authorities should have taken much more decisive action. “They didn't act properly, like most schools would do,” Schwartz said. “When a threat is made like that, the first thing that they should be doing is closing the school, informing all the parents about the nature of the threat, adding extra security, and making sure that law enforcement has addressed the threat.” Schwartz says that the school authorities should have taken much more decisive action. “They didn't act properly, like most schools would do,” Schwartz said. “When a threat is made like that, the first thing that they should be doing is closing the school, informing all the parents about the nature of the threat, adding extra security, and making sure that law enforcement has addressed the threat.”

Perera, whose three children went through the Carmel school system in recent decades, said the meeting on Monday night about the racist videos was overwhelming because it brought up memories of the attacks her own children had faced. “My children were part of systemic racism and bullying because of who they were,” Perera said. “It is very upsetting. It is deteriorating the hope that I had realizing that there is still so much to fight for.” Perera, whose three children went through the Carmel school system in recent decades, said the meeting on Monday night about the racist videos was overwhelming because it brought up memories of the attacks her own children had faced. “My children were part of systemic racism and bullying because of who they were,” Perera said. “It is very upsetting.
