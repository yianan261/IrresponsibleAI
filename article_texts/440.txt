NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Louisiana authorities’ use of facial recognition technology led to the mistaken-identity arrest of a Georgia man on a fugitive warrant, an attorney said in a case that renews attention to racial disparities in the use of the digital tool.

Randall Reid, 28, was jailed in late November in DeKalb County, Georgia, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported.

His attorney, Tommy Calogero, said authorities erroneously linked Reid to purse thefts in Jefferson Parish and Baton Rouge. Reid, arrested on Nov. 25, was released Dec. 1.

Reid is Black, and his arrest brings new attention to the use of a technology critics say results in a higher rate of misidentification of people of color than of white people.

“They told me I had a warrant out of Jefferson Parish. I said, ‘What is Jefferson Parish?’” Reid said. “I have never been to Louisiana a day in my life. Then they told me it was for theft. So not only have I not been to Louisiana, I also don’t steal.”

Calogero said Reid was falsely linked to the June theft of luxury purses from a consignment shop in Metairie, a New Orleans suburb in Jefferson Parish.

A Baton Rouge Police Department detective then adopted the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office’s identification of Reid to secure an arrest warrant alleging he was among three men involved in another luxury purse theft the same week, court records show, according to the newspaper.

Differences, such as a mole on Reid’s face, prompted the Jefferson sheriff to rescind the warrant, said Calogero, who estimated a 40-pound difference between Reid and the purse thief in surveillance footage.

Jefferson Sheriff Joe Lopinto’s office did not respond to several requests for information from The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate on Reid’s arrest and release, the agency’s use of facial recognition or any safeguards around it.

The agency did not immediately respond to a request, emailed Monday by The Associated Press, for comment on the story and information on the use of the technology.

Reid’s case brings renewed attention to the use of facial recognition tools in Louisiana and elsewhere.

Facial recognition systems have faced criticism because of their mass surveillance capabilities, which raise privacy concerns, and because some studies have shown that the technology is far more likely to misidentify Black and other people of color than white people, which has resulted in mistaken arrests.

Police in New Orleans say facial recognition can be used only to generate leads and that officers must get approval from department officials before lodging a request through the Louisiana State Analytic and Fusion Exchange in Baton Rouge. Under the latest city rules, all possible matches must undergo a peer review by other facial recognition investigators.

Legislation to restrict the use of facial recognition statewide died in a 2021 legislative session.. Police in Louisiana reportedly relied on an incorrect facial recognition match to secure warrants to arrest a Black man for thefts he did not commit.

Randal Reid, 28, was in jail for almost a week after the false match led to his arrest, according to a report published Monday on NOLA.com, the website of the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate newspaper. Reid told the newspaper that he had never even been to Louisiana:

Local police pulled over Reid on Nov. 25 as he drove on Interstate 20 in DeKalb County, Georgia, headed to a late Thanksgiving celebration with his mother, he said. "They told me I had a warrant out of Jefferson Parish. I said, 'What is Jefferson Parish?,'" Reid said. "I have never been to Louisiana a day in my life. Then they told me it was for theft. So not only have I not been to Louisiana, I also don't steal." Reid was booked into the DeKalb County jail as a fugitive but was let go on Dec. 1, a jail official said.

Reid's lawyer, Tommy Calogero, said that Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office detectives "tacitly" admitted the error and rescinded the warrant, the report said. "I think they realized they went out on a limb making an arrest based on a face," Calogero said.

“Police could have checked his height and weight”

Describing his time in jail, Reid said he was "not eating, not sleeping. I'm thinking about these charges. Not doing anything because I don't know what's really going on the whole time. They didn't even try to make the right ID."

The case reportedly began with a June 2022 theft of more than $10,000 worth of Chanel and Louis Vuitton purses in Metairie, Louisiana. Calogero said it wouldn't have been hard to determine that Reid wasn't the culprit, who was reportedly "caught on camera in June entering numbers from a stolen credit card at the register" in the store.

A mole on Reid's face was one of the differences that ultimately forced police to release him, Calogero said. Calogero also "estimated a 40-pound difference between Reid and the purse thief he saw in surveillance footage," the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate report said. The culprit, unlike Reid, had "flabby arms."

"Police could have checked his height and weight or made an effort to speak to him or asked to walk through his house to look for evidence. He would have complied," Calogero told the newspaper.

It's not clear exactly what facial recognition was used in this case. In previous cases, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joe Lopinto's office requested facial recognition analyses through the Louisiana State Analytic and Fusion Exchange in Baton Rouge, which uses Clearview AI and MorphoTrak systems, the report said.

Clearview software compares faces to pictures on social media and many other sources. "Our platform, powered by facial recognition technology, includes the largest known database of 30+ billion facial images sourced from public-only web sources, including news media, mugshot websites, public social media, and other open sources," the company's website says.

Sheriff’s office denied newspaper’s request for warrant

The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate report indicates that the wrong facial recognition match led to two warrants for Reid's arrest. The first was obtained by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, and the second was for a separate crime being investigated by Baton Rouge police.

"A Baton Rouge Police Department detective then adopted JPSO's identification of Reid to secure an arrest warrant alleging he was among three men involved in another luxury purse theft the same week at a shop on Jefferson Highway, court records show," the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate report said.

The report said Lopinto's office did not respond to requests for information and "denied a formal request for the July 18 arrest warrant for Reid and copies of policies or purchases related to facial recognition, citing an ongoing investigation." The separate warrant obtained by Baton Rouge police "does not say how Lopinto's office identified Reid," the report said.

Privacy concerns and evidence of bias in facial recognition systems have fueled a movement to ban government use of the technology. "Facial recognition software is particularly bad at recognizing African-Americans and other ethnic minorities, women, and young people, often misidentifying or failing to identify them, disparately impacting certain groups," the Electronic Frontier Foundation says.. Randall Reid says he’s never even been to Louisiana, much less stolen $10,000 worth of Chanel and Louis Vuitton handbags there. That didn’t stop police from arresting the 28-year-old Georgia resident for the theft, committed in a New Orleans suburb, based on an algorithmic guess at what his face looked like. Reid was on the way to a belated Thanksgiving dinner with his mother when the cops picked him up, three states and seven hours away from the scene of the crime. He was locked up for nearly a week.

A facial recognition tool identified Reid as a suspect in the theft of the luxury purses, and that was all the cops needed to put him in jail, according to the New Orleans Advocate. According to Reid’s lawyer Tommy Calogero, he’s a good 40 pounds lighter than the criminal in the surveillance tape. Law enforcement let him go and admitted the false match “tacitly,” Calogero said.

“I think they realized they went out on a limb making an arrest based on a face,” Calogero told the Advocate.t

Facial recognition, though useful, is far from perfect. Numerous studies show the technology is especially inaccurate when identifying people of color and women compared to identifications of white men. Some law enforcement officials regularly acknowledge this fact, saying facial recognition is only suitable to generate leads and should never be used as the sole basis for arrest warrants. But there are very few rules governing the technology. Cops often ignore that advice and take face recognition at face value.

Reid is only the latest seemingly innocent Black man to wind up in jail as a result of facial recognition’s errors. The technology has led to at least three wrongful arrests, and using facial recognition as the only justification to put suspects behind bars is a troubling and growing trend, according to Clare Garvie, training resource counsel with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.



“Facial recognition offers the promise of accurate and speedy identification in circumstances where law enforcement might not have other ways to identify suspects, but that assumption has never been tested or confirmed,” Garvie said. “When law enforcement officials use the technology as the sole basis for arrests, they are relying on unproven methods.”

Our world is absolutely saturated with facial recognition technology and other biometric sensors. But we don’t know how these tools are used, or under what circumstances. Last year, 13 out of 14 federal government agencies told Congress they have no idea how often they use facial recognition technology, or even which of their employees have access to it.



This time last year, it seemed like there was a growing movement to ban law enforcement’s use of technology, with legislatures across the country instituting a facial recognition prohibition for their police forces. But that movement lost steam, and a number of states and cities quietly undid their face recognition bans, including California, Virginia, and—you guessed it—New Orleans.

New Orleans—which borders Metairie, LA, where Reid was accused of theft—has rules about how police use facial recognition. By law, all possible matches have to go through peer review by other facial recognition investigators, and police policy says the tech should only be used to generate leads. But in Metairie, the rest of Louisiana, and most of the country, law enforcement officials can use facial recognition without restriction. In most cases, prosecutors don’t even have to disclose that facial recognition was involved in investigations when suspects make it to court.



That violates defendants constitutional rights, Garvie maintains. The so-called Brady Rule requires that prosecutors disclose evidence that could held a defendant’s case. Because facial recognition is so inaccurate, Garvie said that should apply whenever the technology is used. But so far, the court system hasn’t adopted that logic.

Law enforcement agencies’ use of facial recognition goes back 20 years. We have no idea how many people are in prison thanks to the flawed technology, experts told Gizmodo.



“Unfortunately, Randall Reid will not be the last person falsely arrested due police use of facial recognition technology,” said Evan Selinger, scholar-in-residence at Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. “When there’s a political need to be seen as committed to decisive action, high-tech options—even deeply flawed and highly controversial ones—can have good short-term optics.”

The Baton Rouge Police Department, which issued the warrant for his arrest, has been tight-lipped about the case. According to the Advocate, the department denied a formal request for the arrest warrant and hasn’t disclosed details about its facial recognition policies.

For the better part of a century, an untold number of people were convicted of crimes using bogus forensic science like bite mark analysis and hair analysis. With facial recognition, it seems we may be heading down the same path: the US is waiting for case law to determine how cops should and shouldn’t use facial recognition technology. That means innocent people will go to jail for crimes they didn’t commit while we sit and watch them fight their way through the court system..
