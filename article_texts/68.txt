Alas, it seems we've got a few more years before the robots take over.

A security robot created by the company Knightscope was patrolling an office complex in Washington D.C. when it rolled into a fountain and met its untimely demise on Monday.

The incident went viral on Twitter after Bilal Farooqui, an employee at the Washington Harbour complex, tweeted a photo of the 300-pound android, writing: 'We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots.'

The K5 robot, which measures about five-feet tall, is rented out to malls, office buildings, and parking lots to enforce order with a built-in video camera, license plate recognition, and thermal imaging.

Billed as an 'autonomous presence' that can 'guide [itself] through even the most complex environments', the robot spins around and whistles.

It appears the drudgery became too much on Monday when the robot rolled down some stairs and fell into the fountain.

Employees were pictured hauling the robot out of the water, and Knightscope said it would deliver a new robot to the office building for free.

After Farooqui posted a photo of the robot partially submerged, Twitter users went wild over the image.

Guillermo Meneses shared a previous photo of himself standing next to the robot, joking: 'My remembrance moment with Steve the Robot. Just last Friday. We were such good friends; he looked so happy and healthy'

Adam Singer wrote: 'That robot is what all of us want to do in 2017.'

User Chris Mahan tweeted: 'Just put it in a big bowl of rice and wait three days.'

Peter Singer wrote: 'Steps are our best defense against the Robopocalypse.'

Colin Weir questioned the robot's efficacy, writing: 'I had a cheap second hand roomba that could avoid stairs.'

Brett Rosner tweeted 'Rest in pieces', while Tony Solorzano made a reference to the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

'Somewhere at the end of the universe, Marvin the Paranoid Android is looking up and saying, "sigh... Amateur...,"' he wrote.

This isn't the first time a Knightscope robot has made headlines. One rolled over a 16-month-old boy in Stanford, California, last summer.

In April, Jason Sylvain, 41, was arrested for drunkenly attacking a robot in a Mountain View, California parking lot.. The machine uprising has been dealt a serious blow after a robot cop was found face down in a fountain.

Built to autonomously patrol offices and shopping malls, the Knightscope K5 security robot is meant to be able to navigate environments and keep unruly humans in check. Instead, after being deployed to a Washington DC office block, it was found drowned in a watery grave. Much like a Dalek, it appears to have been defeated by stairs.

Our D.C. office building got a security robot. It drowned itself.

The bizarro egg-shaped robot’s premature demise is not thought to be suspicious. It is believed the robot fell down the steps of its own fecklessness.

Stacy Dean Stephens, vice president of marketing and sales at Knightscope, told Cnet that it was an “isolated incident” for the K5 unit and that “no people were harmed or involved in any way”, although apparently humans in wellies were required to fish out the defunct robot.

Since taking the streets in limited numbers, the K5 patrol bot, which is apparently packed with sensors to be the smart eyes and ears for its human law enforcement colleagues, has had its fair share of incidents. In April, a K5 patrolling the mean streets of Google-home-town Mountain View, California was allegedly involved in a carpark altercation with a 41-year-old man, while in July 2016 another K5 unit was accused of running over a 16-month-old child in a Stanford shopping centre.
