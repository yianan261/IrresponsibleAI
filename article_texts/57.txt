The federal government has finally agreed to pay back hundreds of thousands of people who were hit with unlawful and incorrect Centrelink debts over a four-year period through the Coalition’s botched robodebt scheme.

Years after vowing to recoup at least $3bn from welfare recipients and doggedly defending the program’s legality, the government said on Friday it would repay 470,000 debts that were entirely or partially raised using the discredited “income-averaging” calculations.

Stuart Robert, the government services minister, said the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and would include recovery fee charges. The debt refunds would begin from July, he said.

Robert, who was also the human services minister in 2015 when aspects of the robodebt scheme were established, did not apologise on Friday, saying the scheme “was developed to make identifying welfare overpayments more efficient”.

The announcement, delivered in the shadow of a federal court class action, confirmed reporting by the Guardian revealing the government had privately acknowledged it would need to pay back hundreds of thousands of people.

Robert’s statement did not say whether the government would agree to pay interest on the debts, a key demand from the class action led by Gordon Legal.

The firm vowed on Friday to continue to pursue compensation, arguing the court should approve the refunds process to ensure victims maintained their rights to claim damages and interest.

Guardian Australia has previously revealed the government was reluctant to pay interest and that the Commonwealth’s legal team was instructed to oppose interest repayments in mediation, which is due to begin next month.

It is also understood no decision has yet been made on the future of the program.

But Robert said on Friday the government would “move forward with our income compliance program with further proof points to ensure it remains sufficient”.

“The government started this program over half a decade ago based on the best information at the time,” he said.

“The information presented to me saw a change in November, I acted swiftly on behalf of the government to pause debt recovery and to refine the system. So again, we’re moving forward on the best information we have.”

Bill Shorten, Labor’s government services spokesman, said the government only offered the refund because a court date had been set for July.

“Government ministers were going to have to turn up to court in empty witness-box seats and explain what they knew, when they knew, why the federal government … had been taking hundreds of millions of dollars off vulnerable Australians and why they had no legal authority to do these actions,” he said.

The Greens senator and long-time robobdebt critic, Rachel Siewert, said it was a “historic day”.

“I am overwhelmed thinking of the untold suffering that this illegal scheme has caused,” she said.

The origins of the robodebt scheme date back to July 2015 and involved a combination of data-matching to identify potential targets and faulty debt calculations by “income averaging” annual tax office pay data and comparing it to fortnightly pay declared by welfare recipients.

It also featured a heavily reliance on Centrelink labour hire staff tasked with calculating debts and sending out letters, while millions were spent contracting private debt collection agencies to chase up people who ignored debt letters.

During the 2016 federal election, the Turnbull government promised to bolster the program, which was yet to cause great scandal, promising to enhance income-data matching by using ATO pay data to chase up alleged debts.

But in late 2016, the scheme erupted in scandal as a growing number of people started complaining about receiving debts. Centrelink had boosted “compliance interventions” from 20,000 per year to 20,000 per week, according to then human services minister Alan Tudge.

Since then, critics have argued the system relies on a crude calculation of a person’s income, by taking annual income data held by the tax office and “averaging” it over each fortnight.

In order to challenge the debt, welfare recipients were told to provide payslips or bank statements to prove the income they had reported to Centrelink at the time was correct.

Scheme becomes scandal in 2016

In late 2016, Christian Porter, the social services minister at the time, made a virtue of the fact most debts were simply calculated using the ATO averaged calculations.

Defending the scheme, he said: “Monies are being identified and being paid back to the taxpayer – indeed, $300 million so far, with a tiny complaint rate, and only in a very rare and few instances, indeed 2.2%, has there even been the requirement for documentary evidence to be provided.”

In November, the government settled a federal court case brought by Victoria Legal Aid and announced it would no longer raise debts without first gathering evidence – such as payslips – to prove a person had underreported their earnings to Centrelink.

But at the time, Robert refused to apologise, describing the change as only a “refinement” and saying only a “small cohort” were affected.

In fact, secret government documents seen by the Guardian show Services Australia believes the scheme is only viable if it is able to demands welfare recipients to gather this evidence from the past employers’ in order to prove they did not owe the debt.

The debts related to alleged overpayments dated as far back as six years, by which point many recipients had changed employers and stopped receiving benefits.

Robert claimed on Friday he had acted as soon as “information came to light that showed there was a lack of sufficiency” around the debts raised using “income averaging”.

But although the scheme was not challenged in the courts until last year, the government was warned about its shaky legal foundations in 2017 when a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled five times that debts raised under the scheme were unlawful.

The first of two Senate inquiries into the scheme in 2018 heard claims from Greens senator Rachel Siewert that the families of at least five people said receiving a robodebt letter was a factor in their death.

Government advice seen by the Guardian showed the government expected in March to administer about 450,000 refunds, and that legal advice advised officials to seek a settlement on the basis it would likely lose in court on the “unjust enrichment” claim.

It abandoned a planned ramp-up of the scheme after Guardian Australia reported a leaked plan to target the vulnerable in 2019.

Do you know more? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com. Nathan Kearney says he lost two and half years of his life to robodebt. He’s still seeing a counsellor about it.

Four years ago he was living in Brisbane, seeing and playing gigs, working several different casual jobs and generally enjoying his 20s.

Then the debts came, first for about $2,000, and a year later for $4,500. It was the same story: you have underreported your income, you owe us this much money, please provide us your old payslips. He couldn’t.

Overwhelmed by the idea he now owed the government more than $6,000, Kearney moved back in with his parents in East Gippsland.

I wanted to know why those ministers felt that it was appropriate to use this illegal system and to target the most vulnerable Nathan Kearney

He was 27, dreams on hold, while he worked 50 hours a week in a country town he didn’t like just to regain a sense of financial stability.

“I feel like I got put back a couple of years in life because of this,” Kearney says. “And I would be closer to where I want to be at 31 years old if it hadn’t been for robodebt.”

On Monday the government reached a settlement with Gordon Legal, a law firm running a class action on behalf of hundreds of thousands of people caught up in the Coalition’s government welfare debt recovery program.

The settlement was for an eye-watering $1.2bn but almost all of the money came from the government’s May announcement to repay and wipe debts raised using the unlawful “income-averaging” of ATO pay data.

In fact, the only new figure was $111m in compensation that will be shared between about 430,000 victims.

The sums will vary significantly, depending on how much debt people had paid and how long they’d been without their money. Legal costs, which will be deducted from the compensation, are yet to be determined.

Many people have flooded victims’ group Facebook pages, as well as Gordon Legal’s own page, to express frustration at the compensation figure, which they feel does not reflect the pain or suffering the four-year program caused.

Moreover, some are angry that a scandal they see as being punctuated by continual cover-up and obfuscation never made it to a courtroom.

“I wanted to know why those ministers felt that it was appropriate to use this illegal system and to target the most vulnerable people,” Kearney says. “I wanted somebody to ask them to their faces: ‘Why did you think that it was OK to take money from the poorest people without giving them a chance to argue their case?’”

Others, like Jennifer Miller, whose son Rhys Cauzzo took his life when he was 28, say they intend to object to the settlement, which will need to be approved by the court. “There has been no accountability whatsoever,” Miller says.

Cauzzo lived with depression and anxiety but Miller believes the financial pressure that came from two Centrelink debts tipped him over the edge on Australia Day 2017.

Along with Kath Madgwick, whose son also took his life after receiving a Centrelink debt, Miller has been campaigning against the robodebt scheme for three years.

Like Kearney, she is insistent the case should have gone to court. “This isn’t over,” she says.

Gordon Legal emphasised this week that the settlement – an “excellent outcome” for clients and group members – should be viewed in its full context.

“When you think about the totality of what’s been achieved since the proceedings were commenced, that really amounts to more than $1.2bn,” said a partner at the law firm, Andrew Grech.

It was the Amato case brought by Victoria Legal Aid that established the legal precedent that ruled that robodebt’s “income averaging” unlawful.

But in the months afterwards, the government simply stonewalled. It said nothing about refunds and claimed only a “small cohort” of people had been affected.

Indeed, the refund decision in May, which Guardian Australia revealed two months earlier, was prompted by the need for a strategy to respond to the Gordon Legal class action.

In the lead-up to Monday’s announcement, it was clear that a settlement was looking likely.

And the $111m figure was said, from the government’s perspective, to represent the interest owed, rather than compensation for stress or anguish.

The government services minister, Stuart Robert, later publicly confirmed the government’s view of the compensation, noting it was for “the most part, for interest payments for money held”.

The commonwealth “has not accepted or admitted any liability in the matter”, Robert noted.

Though victims longed for their day in court, the two-week trial promised to be a fairly dry affair based mostly on documentary evidence and legal arguments.

The government did not plan to call any witnesses, so there was little prospect the former human services minister, Alan Tudge, or top departmental officials would need to take the stand.

In addition, the government’s prospects advice from earlier in the year said while it was likely a court would order refunds, plus interest, Gordon Legal’s negligence claim was unlikely to succeed.

Still, for some victims, the government’s lawyers would have been there in the “virtual” courtroom, defending their case.

Gordon Legal’s statement of claim, for example, alleged Centrelink was well aware of the distress the program had caused victims.

Kearney says it was the second debt that caused his mental health to plummet (he lives with chronic depression). He also fell out with some friends, though he notes they’ve since patched things up.

Because he continued to contest his debts, Centrelink eventually sent them off to a private debt collector who would call him three times a day.

Centrelink also garnisheed nearly $3,000 from his tax return.

“Once they [the debt collectors] started calling, they … put you into a certain headspace, which is like a shame and guilt spiral,” he says. “Whether or not you deserve to feel the shame or guilt, it’s still there within me.

“Sometimes they’d call and I’d tell them, like, ‘I can’t deal with this any more. I’ve been thinking about taking my life,’ and things like that. It didn’t change anything.”

Perhaps as many as 100,000 people were also left out of the refunds because they provided payslips or bank statements after being hit with an initially unlawful debt. It was then recalculated and a debt was substantiated.

And Gordon Legal, which had initially argued these debts were “tainted”, dropped that claim in the settlement.

Some of those people expressed anger and confusion at that outcome in conversations with Guardian Australia this week.

Other refund recipients, like the man who told the Guardian his debt had been a factor in his marriage breakdown, may only get the sense of justice they seek from a royal commission, as proposed by Labor and the Greens.

“I’ve been seeing somebody to actively to talk through, I guess, ‘robodebt-related trauma’ is the way that they put it, and slowly coming to terms with it,” says Kearney, who is now back in Brisbane.

He used to fear another debt might arrive at any moment.

“Now, with the settlement, it does feel like, ‘Everything’s gone back to normal, they’ve made penance … and everything goes good again,’” he says. “Whereas I think a lot of us are still dealing with the impacts of what they did years ago, even if we got our refunds.”
