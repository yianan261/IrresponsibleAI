The federal government has finally agreed to pay back hundreds of thousands of people who were hit with unlawful and incorrect Centrelink debts over a four-year period through the Coalition’s botched robodebt scheme.

Years after vowing to recoup at least $3bn from welfare recipients and doggedly defending the program’s legality, the government said on Friday it would repay 470,000 debts that were entirely or partially raised using the discredited “income-averaging” calculations.

Stuart Robert, the government services minister, said the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and would include recovery fee charges. The debt refunds would begin from July, he said.

Robert, who was also the human services minister in 2015 when aspects of the robodebt scheme were established, did not apologise on Friday, saying the scheme “was developed to make identifying welfare overpayments more efficient”.

The announcement, delivered in the shadow of a federal court class action, confirmed reporting by the Guardian revealing the government had privately acknowledged it would need to pay back hundreds of thousands of people.

Robert’s statement did not say whether the government would agree to pay interest on the debts, a key demand from the class action led by Gordon Legal.

The firm vowed on Friday to continue to pursue compensation, arguing the court should approve the refunds process to ensure victims maintained their rights to claim damages and interest.

Guardian Australia has previously revealed the government was reluctant to pay interest and that the Commonwealth’s legal team was instructed to oppose interest repayments in mediation, which is due to begin next month.

It is also understood no decision has yet been made on the future of the program.

But Robert said on Friday the government would “move forward with our income compliance program with further proof points to ensure it remains sufficient”.

“The government started this program over half a decade ago based on the best information at the time,” he said.

“The information presented to me saw a change in November, I acted swiftly on behalf of the government to pause debt recovery and to refine the system. So again, we’re moving forward on the best information we have.”

Bill Shorten, Labor’s government services spokesman, said the government only offered the refund because a court date had been set for July.

“Government ministers were going to have to turn up to court in empty witness-box seats and explain what they knew, when they knew, why the federal government … had been taking hundreds of millions of dollars off vulnerable Australians and why they had no legal authority to do these actions,” he said.

The Greens senator and long-time robobdebt critic, Rachel Siewert, said it was a “historic day”.

“I am overwhelmed thinking of the untold suffering that this illegal scheme has caused,” she said.

The origins of the robodebt scheme date back to July 2015 and involved a combination of data-matching to identify potential targets and faulty debt calculations by “income averaging” annual tax office pay data and comparing it to fortnightly pay declared by welfare recipients.

It also featured a heavily reliance on Centrelink labour hire staff tasked with calculating debts and sending out letters, while millions were spent contracting private debt collection agencies to chase up people who ignored debt letters.

During the 2016 federal election, the Turnbull government promised to bolster the program, which was yet to cause great scandal, promising to enhance income-data matching by using ATO pay data to chase up alleged debts.

But in late 2016, the scheme erupted in scandal as a growing number of people started complaining about receiving debts. Centrelink had boosted “compliance interventions” from 20,000 per year to 20,000 per week, according to then human services minister Alan Tudge.

Since then, critics have argued the system relies on a crude calculation of a person’s income, by taking annual income data held by the tax office and “averaging” it over each fortnight.

In order to challenge the debt, welfare recipients were told to provide payslips or bank statements to prove the income they had reported to Centrelink at the time was correct.

Scheme becomes scandal in 2016

In late 2016, Christian Porter, the social services minister at the time, made a virtue of the fact most debts were simply calculated using the ATO averaged calculations.

Defending the scheme, he said: “Monies are being identified and being paid back to the taxpayer – indeed, $300 million so far, with a tiny complaint rate, and only in a very rare and few instances, indeed 2.2%, has there even been the requirement for documentary evidence to be provided.”

In November, the government settled a federal court case brought by Victoria Legal Aid and announced it would no longer raise debts without first gathering evidence – such as payslips – to prove a person had underreported their earnings to Centrelink.

But at the time, Robert refused to apologise, describing the change as only a “refinement” and saying only a “small cohort” were affected.

In fact, secret government documents seen by the Guardian show Services Australia believes the scheme is only viable if it is able to demands welfare recipients to gather this evidence from the past employers’ in order to prove they did not owe the debt.

The debts related to alleged overpayments dated as far back as six years, by which point many recipients had changed employers and stopped receiving benefits.

Robert claimed on Friday he had acted as soon as “information came to light that showed there was a lack of sufficiency” around the debts raised using “income averaging”.

But although the scheme was not challenged in the courts until last year, the government was warned about its shaky legal foundations in 2017 when a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled five times that debts raised under the scheme were unlawful.

The first of two Senate inquiries into the scheme in 2018 heard claims from Greens senator Rachel Siewert that the families of at least five people said receiving a robodebt letter was a factor in their death.

Government advice seen by the Guardian showed the government expected in March to administer about 450,000 refunds, and that legal advice advised officials to seek a settlement on the basis it would likely lose in court on the “unjust enrichment” claim.

It abandoned a planned ramp-up of the scheme after Guardian Australia reported a leaked plan to target the vulnerable in 2019.

Do you know more? luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com. An ombudsman’s report on the roll out of Centrelink’s automated debt recovery service has identified multiple failures that placed unreasonable burdens on welfare recipients and staff.

The self-initiated investigation was announced in January after months of complaints that the problem-riddled system was sending incorrect debt notices to people.

“The [Online Compliance Intervention] project effectively shifted complex fact finding and data entry functions from the department to the individual and its success relied on its usability,” said the report by acting commonwealth ombudsman, Richard Glenn.

In July 2016 the Department of Human Services switched to an automated system of data-matching to identify welfare fraud.

Glenn found the switch did not see an increase in the 20% rate of people who were sent debt notices but then found not to owe a debt, and it was “entirely reasonable and appropriate” for the department to ask customers to explain discrepancies.

However, this was only as long as the system had complete and accurate information, it said, and the department’s processes placed a greater emphasis on the customer’s responsibility, which was “not reasonable or fair” in many situations.

The department’s requirement for people to keep records for six or seven years was not reasonable, the report found, “particularly when they have not been forewarned about this requirement”.

“Customers do not have the same information gathering powers as DHS.”

The report also highlighted a litany of other issues related to planning, implementation, consultation, expectations of welfare recipients and staff, and a lack of understanding and communication about the new system’s complicated nature.

While it was inevitable there would be issues when rolling out “a large scale, complex automated system in a short timeframe”, the department failed to properly mitigate risks during transition or consult adequately in the planning processes.

“DHS did not clearly communicate aspects of the system to its customers and staff, which led to confusion and misunderstanding.”

The ombudsman acknowledged improvements already made by the department but said there was more needed.

The report identified key issues including:

The accuracy of debts raised, in particular those that were calculated using “averaged” income data.

The 10% recovery fee.

The transparency and usability of the OCI system.

The problems faced by customers when gathering evidence and presenting their case.

The adequacy of the department’s assistance and communication with customers.

The adequacy of staff training and communication to support customers using the system.

The department’s approach to complaints.

The adequacy of the department’s project planning and governance mechanisms.

Among its findings, the report said the department’s initial letters to welfare recipients were “unclear and deficient in many respects” and left out crucial information, including that their income would be averaged out if they didn’t enter it each fortnight.

The letters were also missing contact numbers for the compliance team, which led people to call the general line and face long wait times and unprepared staff who often did not know how the system worked.

The 21-day timeframe to respond to the initial letter was also not reasonable or fair in all circumstances.

The ombudsman’s reports concluded the implementation problems could have been mitigated with better planning and risk management, including user testing, a more incremental roll out and better communication with staff and stakeholders.

The federal government has stridently defended the debt recovery system, including going so far as to release personal details about a welfare recipient to media in order to publicly rebut complaints.

The human services minister, Alan Tudge, said the government welcomed the report and accepted all recommendations.

In a statement, Tudge repeatedly noted the parts of the report that defended the automated system and said the government was already making improvements that, in some cases, went further than what was suggested by the ombudsman.

“The unfortunate reality is that while most welfare recipients do the right thing, some deliberately defraud the system while others inadvertently fail to accurately declare their income and consequently receive an overpayment,” he said.

“We want to be fair and reasonable to welfare recipient but also fair to the taxpayer who pays for the welfare payments.”

The shadow human services minister, Linda Burney, said the report raised “serious questions about Alan Tudge’s oversight of his department”.

“While some changes have been made to Tudge’s robo-debt system, the ombudsman is clear they don’t go far enough,” she said. “The minister has no one to blame but himself. According to the ombudsman, all of these issues could have been avoided with proper planning and consultation.”

The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said Labor maintained the system should be suspended for a review.. The Australian government has privately acknowledged the robodebt scandal may go beyond the unlawful 470,000 debts already identified for refunds, but it has no plans to pay back the money because it believes it would be too difficult to identify victims.

Amid growing fears unlawful debts could date back decades, the Guardian can reveal ministers were told in February the now unlawful ATO income averaging method was a longstanding “last resort” practice used to enforce Centrelink overpayment debts.

Confidential advice seen by the Guardian said: “As the identified invalidity would apply to all versions of the practice, there is a risk of Commonwealth liability for all actions outside the Programme including pre-1 July 2015 actions.

“The proposed approach would not address that potential liability. Any claims will be managed on a case-by-base basis.”

The government on Friday conceded the practice – which enforces debts using ATO annual income data compared against fortnightly pay reported by Centrelink recipients – was unlawful as it vowed to repay 330,000 people affected by faulty debts.

But it only promised to issue refunds to “all income compliance debts raised from our use of income averaging since 2015-16”.

The advice does not state the potential number of debts issued to people before 2015 that were raised using income averaging, or their value, but experts said it was likely to be much smaller than the post-2015 debts.

However, the Department of Human Services has previously told the commonwealth ombudsman it had used the practice since the early 1980s. Guardian Australia has seen records from one likely case dating back to 2008.

In the ministerial submission, prepared for Stuart Robert, Anne Ruston and Christian Porter by Services Australia, it was claimed that pre-2015 victims would be too difficult to identify.

The ministers were also told the issue was less pressing because any pre-2015 debts were not targeted by the ongoing class action brought by Gordon Legal.

It is the latest in a series of revelations from the leaked advice, which allowed the Guardian to report in March that the government had conceded it would need to refund hundreds of thousands of robodebts.

Darren O’Donovan, a prominent expert on the robodebt scheme, called for a full independent judicial inquiry and a forensic audit of all files.

“We must have the full truth about this department’s stubbornly unlawful debt raising,” O’Donovan said. “Were they ever going to tell people?”

The La Trobe University administrative law academic acknowledged the number of unlawful debts raised before 2015 would be “much smaller” when “compared to the industrial upfront averaging which began in 2015”.

“But each and every one of these will have been life-changing for those on the margins,” he said. “We have no idea how many employers answered requests for information, how many records were unavailable.”

Guardian Australia approached Robert and Services Australia for comment about whether it would repay pre-2015 income-averaged debts, and whether unlawful debts could date back to the early 1980s.

Robert’s office referred questions to the agency, whose spokesman, Hank Jongen, said: “This announcement only relates to the Income Compliance Program introduced in the 2015-16 financial year.

“Services Australia conducts all welfare payment administration in good faith, based on the best understanding of social security law when decisions are made.

“All decisions can be appealed and anyone who has concerns about a ruling made by the agency can seek a review at any time.”

Ahead of a potential class action trial, Robert, the government services minister, announced on Friday his agency would begin processing $721m worth of refunds from July.

Services Australia justified excluding pre-2015 debts by arguing a lack of “standardised tools and systems” meant “in most other cases it is not possible to identity the use of averaged ATO income data” outside the income compliance – or robodebt – program.

The advice also noted the class action brought by Gordon Legal “related only to debts raised after 1 July 2015 in the Programme”, which meant not addressing these debts “therefore will not affect settlement of the class action”.

But O’Donovan said every debt “regardless of age must be audited”.

That included debts substantiated using bank statements, which the Guardian on Saturday revealed the government had also admitted could not be legally used to enforce Centrelink overpayments.

“Any debt issued on the basis of averaged data alone must be set aside,” O’Donovan said. “The fact that averaging was used as a last resort after unsuccessful searches for payslips does not change the legal position. A debt must be based on rational proof of actual earned fortnightly income.”

Guardian Australia has seen records from one appeal made to Centrelink in 2017 that refers to the agency having used ATO data as the “most accurate source of information” to raise a debt in May 2008.

It is understood the welfare recipient had appealed about a decade later, once the robodebt scandal had emerged.

A Centrelink authorised review officer said in the 2017 decision the “unavailability of … wage records or bank statements” in late 2007 meant it was “correct to use annualised ATO information to determine the overpayment”.

Under income averaging, Centrelink staff used ATO pay information to calculate a debt by dividing a yearly income summary into 26 fortnights and data-matching the results against what a welfare recipient reported to the agency while they received benefits.

Compliance officers manually conducted this work before it was automated on a small scale using data-matching by the former Labor government in 2011.

The results of ATO income averaged pay calculations were used to ask welfare recipients to “update” their income records and if a discrepancy remained, Centrelink would issue an overpayment debt and in some cases seize the person’s tax return.

Income averaging was used only as a “last resort” until 2015, when the Coalition turbocharged the income compliance program, boosting the number of “compliance interventions” from 20,000 a year to 20,000 a week in the quest for budget savings.
