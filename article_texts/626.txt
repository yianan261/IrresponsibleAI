Deepfakes, technology to face-swap images, have ushered in a new era of scams. In the past year, fake video of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Mr. Beast have been used to shill products they don't actually endorse. The latest of these scams is a phony giveaway of cookware Le Creuset by deepfaked Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, the New York Times and others report.

In these AI-generated videos that ran on Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok, Swift's appearance and voice were imitated to express that she's "thrilled" to give away free Le Creuset sets. There are also fake ads of Selena Gomez, according to cybersecurity site MalwareTips, where a deepfaked Gomez promises free cookware due to a warehouse error.

These ads included links to websites appearing to be the Food Network and other legitimate news outlets, saying that the "free" Le Creuset items required a one-time "small shipping fee of $9.96." Users that attempted to claim the free set and entered their personal information didn't receive any Le Creuset, but instead were signed up to a monthly $89.95 subscription in addition to that "shipping" fee of $9.96, MalwareTips states.

A Meta spokesperson told the Times that these fraudulent ads violate its policies, but are often missed by its review systems because creators cloak their content. Meta has taken legal action against some perpetrators of these scam ads. A TikTok spokesperson told the Times that creators are required to disclose whether media is synthetic or manipulated, and that advertisers must obtain consent for "any synthetic media which contains a public figure."

AI fools us — and will continue to as the technology advances. Here's a rule of thumb: If an ad featuring a celebrity isn't on that celebrity's or the company's social media accounts, it's likely fake.. Taylor Swift’s affinity for Le Creuset is real: Her collection of the cookware has been featured on a Tumblr account dedicated to the pop star’s home décor, showcased in her gift choices at a fan’s bridal shower and shown in a Netflix documentary that was highlighted by Le Creuset’s Facebook page.

What is not real: Ms. Swift’s endorsement of the company’s products, which have appeared in recent weeks in ads on Facebook and elsewhere featuring her face and voice.

The ads are among the many celebrity-focused scams made far more convincing by artificial intelligence. Within a single week in October, the actor Tom Hanks, the journalist Gayle King and the YouTube personality MrBeast all said that A.I. versions of themselves had been used, without permission, for deceptive dental plan promotions, iPhone giveaway offers and other ads.

In Ms. Swift’s case, experts said, artificial intelligence technology helped create a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, which was cobbled together with footage of her alongside clips showing Le Creuset Dutch ovens. In several ads, Ms. Swift’s cloned voice addressed “Swifties” — her fans — and said she was “thrilled” to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.. (NewsNation) — Swifties, avid fans of pop sensation Taylor Swift, are falling victim to a sophisticated AI-generated scam that uses deepfake technology to dupe users into divulging sensitive information and parting with their hard-earned money.

The scheme involves an AI-generated advertisement promoting a fake giveaway purportedly between Swift and Le Creuset, a popular cookware brand. The scammers strategically exploit the celebrity’s image and popularity to lend credibility to their fraudulent scheme.

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the voice says in a robotic tone. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

In a statement, the cookware company said it had nothing to do with the fake ad, NBC news reported.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” Le Creuset said. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

NewsNation’s law and justice contributor, Jennifer Coffindaffer emphasized the convincing nature of the deepfake video, noting that even devoted fans found it challenging to distinguish between authentic content and the scam.

“If it’s something that they’re endorsing, go ahead and do just a little bit of homework,” Coffindaffer advised. “Click on that product and go on to the web to see if her picture comes up. If you don’t see that picture of her, she’s not endorsing it because that’s the biggest thing they would want to show in their advertisement.”

The difficulty in discerning deepfake content grows as the technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it nearly impossible for the naked eye to differentiate between genuine and manipulated videos.

Coffindaffer acknowledged the challenges posed by scammers operating from foreign jurisdictions, making it challenging for law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to take effective action.

“They will keep getting away with it if they’re truly in another country,” she explained. “It’s very difficult to bring anyone to justice.”

The former FBI special agent highlighted the importance of tracing the financial trail to identify the culprits behind such scams. While the FBI has legal liaisons in many countries, the complexities of international jurisdiction present significant obstacles in prosecuting offenders.. These scammers are gonna be on the receiving end of some bad “Karma.”

Several die-hard Taylor Swift fans have been reportedly scammed out of hundreds of dollars after tricksters released advertisements employing AI-generated video of the Grammy winner peddling Le Creuset in an attempt to steal money and data from fans.

The ads — which can be found across all social media platforms — show Swift, 34, standing next to the Le Creuset Dutch oven, which, according to the official website, runs anywhere from $180 to $750 depending on the size and style.

According to a report by the New York Times, the fake Swift tells fans that she is “thrilled” to be giving away free sets of the expensive cookware, but only if they click on a link and answer a few questions.

The report reveals that several participants were sent to what seemed like legitimate websites populated with several fake reviews and coverage.

The website then asks hopeful buyers to fork over a “small shipping fee of $9.96.” Buyers are then unknowingly hit with recurring charges without ever actually receiving the pot.

“These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” computer science professor Siwei Lyu told the Times of the computer-rendered Swift video. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.”

According to Lyu, the ad copy was likely derived from a text-to-speech platform.

Swift is the latest of several celebrities to be impersonated by AI.

Last month, the voice-cloning startup Respeecher managed to re-create the voice of Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart by employing a voice actor to mimic the late actor’s style of speech.

The voice of Stewart, who gained notoriety for films such as “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Rear Window,” appears on the app in a premium story called “It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story,” billed as a “heartwarming new holiday tale” on the Calm app.

4 According to a report by the New York Times, the fake Swift tells fans that she is “thrilled” to be giving away free sets of the expensive cookware but only if they click on a link and answer a few questions.

The Post also previously reported that Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks have fallen victim to AI voice-cloning without their permission.

Johansson officially took legal action in November after an artificial intelligence app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar used the actress’ face and voice in an advertisement.

“We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have,” the “Avengers” star’s’ attorney told Variety at the time.

Hanks took to his Instagram in October to warn fans that he was not peddling a dental plan when a video using his likeness emerged.

“Beware!!” Hanks, 67, wrote beneath a photo of his lookalike. “There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me.”

“I have nothing to do with it,” the “Forrest Gump” star added.. Le Creuset said it’s not affiliated with the artificial intelligence-generated Taylor Swift ad that has popped up online appearing to promote a cookware set.

The ad, which began circulating on social media earlier this month, used Swift’s likeness by deepfaking her voice and layering it over camera shots of Le Creuset cookware spliced with clips of her speaking.

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the voice says in a robotic tone. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

It appears to have originally been posted by a Facebook page titled “The most profitable shares," and as of Wednesday morning it had amassed about 2,300 views. A spokesperson for Meta told NBC News that the ad has been removed.

A spokesperson for Swift did not respond to a request for comment.

In a statement, the cookware company said it has nothing to do with the fake ad.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” Le Creuset said. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

The ad is the latest in a string of AI-generated posts attempting to fake a celebrity's or influencer's endorsement of a product.

In November, Scarlett Johansson’s legal team demanded the app Lisa AI, which generates stylized avatars based on real photos of people, to stop using an AI-generated version of her in an online ad.

YouTube star MrBeast has also called out a viral deepfake video using his face and voice to advertise an purported iPhone 15 giveaway — just days after Tom Hanks posted his own statement on Instagram to clarify that he had “nothing to do with” a video using his AI-generated likeness to promote a dental plan.

Although deepfake technology has been around for years, rapid advancements in generative AI over the past year — along with its growing mainstream use — have sparked renewed concern over the ease of replicating people’s likenesses without consent.

In August, NBC News viewed more than 50 videos posted to platforms like Facebook, TikTok and YouTube that used digitally manipulated images and audio of public figures. All of those videos seemingly aimed to scam viewers of their money.

The increasing accessibility of this technology has even led experts to speculate on the possibility of a “deepfake election” cycle this year, with political disinformation through AI-manipulated videos likely to run rampant. Others also worry about a growing market for deepfake porn, which thrives off producing fake videos featuring the likenesses of real people without their consent.. AI-generated video spots featuring the likeness of Taylor Swift endorsing a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway have duped some fans into buying into the scam, the New York Times reported.

While Swift may be a fan of Le Creuset, she has no official marketing ties to the company. But ads permeating Facebook and other social media platforms would have you think otherwise.

The woman seen in the faux promotional video is neither Swift, nor even a real person. Instead, artificial intelligence has been used to replicate the singer's voice and appearance to create a convincing replication known as a "deepfake." Scammers create this type of synthetic content with machine learning software to create fake footage of public figures using authentic video and audio clips of them, which are abundant and easy to come by online.

"Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here," the deepfake replica of Swift says in the video. "Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."

Users are directed by the AI-generated woman to click a button below the ad to complete a survey, and to do so immediately "as supplies are running out."

It's unclear who is behind the scams. A Facebook account called "The most profitable shares" was one poster of the Swift-inspired scam.

Le Creuset apologized to its cookware fans who were duped by the deepfake.

"Le Creuset does not have any kind of partnership with Taylor Swift. That is a scam and we're working diligently to have those posts taken down," the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.

Swift does indeed appear to be a fan of the high-end cookware brand's wares. Le Creuset shared an image from Swift's Netflix documentary, "Miss Americana," showing Swift in her kitchen using the brand's round dutch oven, which retails for up to $625.

A representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.

To be sure, Swift isn't the only celebrity target of social media swindlers. As artificial intelligence technology becomes more sophisticated, these types of deepfake scams are on the rise, the Better Business Bureau warned last April.

"Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account," the BBB said in a post. "The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you'll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn't exist."

Actor Tom Hanks and CBS Mornings host Gayle King have both had their likenesses used to hawk products they don't endorse.

King reposted a fake weight loss-related video from a company called Artipet on her own Instagram account with a statement saying she is in no way affiliated with the company or alleged product, and warning her followers not to "be fooled by these AI videos.".

These fraudsters need a “Getaway Car.”

Scammers created AI-generated advertisements of what looked and sounded like Taylor Swift hawking Le Creuset to steal data and money from Swifties, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

The “Cruel Summer” singer, 34, is a longtime fan of the luxury cookware brand; its Round Dutch Oven, Demi Teakettle and Cast Iron Skillet (among other items) all have places of pride in her kitchen.

However, she has not officially endorsed Le Creuset and was not involved in any way with the forged ads that have been popping up on Facebook, TikTok and other sites in recent weeks.

Experts told the outlet that artificial intelligence technology was used to help create a manufactured version of the Grammy winner’s voice, which was then paired with deepfake video of the star next to footage of Le Creuset dutch ovens to create the convincing ad.

The French-Belgian brand’s dutch oven can cost anywhere from $180 to $750 depending on the size and style of the dish.

In the fake ads, Swift’s synthetic voice called on “Swifties” and announced that she was “thrilled” to be giving away free cookware sets. The ad then prompted her fans to click a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.

Participants were sent to websites that appeared to be legitimate sites, like the Food Network, and showed fake news coverage of the product along with testimonials by fabricated customers, the New York Times reported.

Hopeful shoppers were then asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware, without realizing that they were getting duped and would face a hidden monthly charge and never receive a posh pot in the mail.

Computer science professor Dr. Siwei Lyu told the newspaper that the con was most likely accomplished using a text-to-speech service.

“These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Dr. Lyu said, adding that it takes less than 45 minutes to create a “decent-quality” video. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.”

Other stars were also reportedly wrapped up in the scheme including interior designer Joanna Gaines, country singer Lainey Wilson and lifestyle blogger Ree Drummond.

Le Creuset told the Times they had no partnership with Swift and urged buyers to only shop their product from their official accounts or website. The company also warned consumers against clicking on suspicious ads.

The pop star’s rep did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.. Taylor Swift is not giving out free Le Creuset products in social media advertisements — though deepfakes of her voice would like you to believe otherwise. A series of posts have recently surfaced on TikTok and in Meta's Ad Library claiming to show Swift offering free Le Creuset cookware sets, the New York Times reports. The ads featured clips where Swift was near Le Creuset products and used a synthetic version of her voice. The scammers used AI to have the cloned voice address her fans, "Swifties," and produce other little remarks.

These posts led interested parties to fake versions of sites like The Food Network with made-up articles and testimonials about Le Creuset. Shoppers were then asked just to provide the $9.96 for shipping to get their free products. Unsurprisingly, no Dutch ovens arrived, and customers had additional monthly charges added to their cards. Le Creuset confirmed no such giveaway was occurring.

Swift is hardly the only celebrity who has recently found their voice co-opted using AI. She's not even the only one used in the scam, with interior designer Joanna Gaines mimicked in ads from verified accounts or ones labeled as sponsored posts. In April 2023, the Better Business Bureau warned consumers about the high quality of ads featuring AI-manufactured versions of celebrities. Since then, scammers have used deepfakes to convince consumers that Luke Combs was selling weight loss gummies, Tom Hanks was promoting dental plans and Gayle King was selling other weight loss products, to name a few examples.

Little regulation exists for monitoring deepfakes or punishing the people who create them. A lot of the responsibility currently falls on the platforms, with YouTube, for example, laying out new steps for reporting deepfakes. At the same time, its working with select musicians to loan their voices out and create greater interest in AI-generated versions of real people.

Last year, two bills were introduced in Congress to address deepfakes: The No Fakes Act and the Deepfakes Accountability Act. However, the fate of both pieces of legislation is uncertain. At the moment, only select states, such as California and Florida, have any AI regulation.. Taylor Swift is not giving away Le Creuset cookware. Those ads are AI-generated and aimed at scamming Swifties.

AI-generated fake advertisements are making the rounds on social media again, this time using the voice and likeness of Taylor Swift promising free Le Creuset cookware sets.

As any proper Swiftie knows, the “Hoax” singer is fan of Le Creuset. In the pop star’s 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” she whipped up some pasta sauce in the brand’s blue dutch oven. And back in 2014, Swift surprised “superfan” Gena Gabrielle by attending her bridal shower with several gifts in tow, including two items from the luxury cookware line.

Scammers used artificial intelligence technology to craft a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The audio was played over various images of Le Creuset products and clips of Swift, some lifted from her 2016 interview with Vogue, “73 Questions with Taylor Swift,” in which the Grammy winner gives the outlet a tour of her home while answering rapid-fire questions.

In multiple social media ads, Swift’s voice is manipulated to sound as though she’s “thrilled” to be giving away to her “loyal fans” free cookware sets that are available due to a “packaging error.” Fans need only to offer up their personal information and pay a $9.96 shipping fee.

A spokesperson for Le Creuset told The Times in a statement that the brand is not not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts,” the statement said. “Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

Representative for Swift did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it easier to create deepfakes and convincing celebrity audio clips. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo, told the New York Times. Lyu added it could take less than 45 minutes to make a “decent-quality video.”

Lyu continued that the fake Le Creuset giveaway was likely created using a text-to-speech service, which can translate a script into an A.I.-generated voice, and then paired with a video using a lip-syncing software.

Last June, “Yellowstone” star and country musician Lainey Wilson saw her voice and likeness used by scammers to peddle weight-loss gummies. The “Heart Like a Truck” hitmaker shared a video on Instagram slamming the fake ads.

“By now I’m sure a lot of y’all have seen some ads about me losing weight, being hospitalized, and then I started taking some weight loss gummies and blah blah blah, they saved my life well surprise — it ain’t true,” she said.

“People will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it’s lies because ain’t nobody sent me any gummies ... I love y’all. I just don’t want y’all spending your money on something that ain’t real, do not fall for it.”

And in September, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks appeared in deepfake dental advertisements. The “Asteroid City” star quickly shot them down via his Instagram, sharing a still from the scam video with the caption, “Beware! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it.”

Company Town Tom Hanks disavows AI clone amid Hollywood’s robot reckoning Acclaimed actor Tom Hanks warned fans that a dental plan being promoted with his likeness is using a fake AI double. His concerns come amid a wider pushback against AI by Hollywood’s actors, who are currently on strike.

Last year, when a sharp uptick in fake celebrity ads began plaguing the internet, USA Today shared a guide for spotting AI-generated videos that explained red flags to look out for, including perfect symmetry, distortion, unusual proportions and unnatural textures. There are also AI-detection tools that can be accessed online, including AI or Not and Maybe’s AI Art Detector.. Swifty Scam: Taylor Swift Is Not Giving Away Le Creuset Cookware

Is Taylor Swift really giving away Le Creuset cookware? No, it’s a scam. Recently, the singer’s likeness has appeared in AI-generated advertisements promoting free giveaways of Le Creuset cookware. According to multiple outlets, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have had the ad appear in recent weeks.

The fake advertisements for the cookware brand use pieced-together clips of the singer with a synthesized version of her voice and images of Le Creuset Dutch ovens.

What is this fake ad saying?

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” a fake advertisement featuring Swift’s augmented voice begins. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

Then, the ad instructs people to click on a button and answer questions in order to receive the brand’s cookware. The false advertisement using Taylor Swift’s voice included different ways that the creators of the fake ad used to legitimize the so-called giveaway. “Get in 10 days! Long waiting but anyway the set is great! Thank you guys!!” one account commented.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” a spokesperson for Le Creuset told NBC News. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

Many people were quick to call out the scam. Some people even shared their experience of falling for the fake advertisement. “I paid the shipping, stupidly, and never received the cookware,” one user commented. “Shame on me for falling for it. Don’t do it!”

The NY Times reported that the Le Creuset scam campaign also featured fabricated versions of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey. In 2022, Winfrey shared a video about the prevalence of fake social media ads, emails, and websites falsely claiming that she endorsed weight loss gummies.

A Meta spokesperson told TODAY.com that the ad has been removed from their platforms. Of course, with anything on the internet, does it truly go away? Check out the fake ad here.

Vintage Gadgets: Outdated Tech That Still Sparks Joy

Best Buy has announced that starting in 2024, following this holiday season, they will discontinue the sale of DVDs, Blu-rays, and 4K Ultra HD discs, both in their physical stores and online. They have said the reason for this decision is due to the increasing popularity of streaming services. This move aligns with the prevailing trend, as more people turn to streaming for their entertainment needs. Physical Media Physical media does come with certain inconveniences, such as taking up space and limited mobile accessibility. But there are still people who appreciate the more traditional way of enjoying movies and music. There are some advantages of owning Blu-rays and DVDs. These include owning what you buy and having bonus content you can’t get anywhere else. Pagers! In the ’90s, owning a pager was considered a status symbol and a fashion statement. Today, it’s even possible to purchase a fully functional vintage Motorola pager from online marketplaces like eBay. Outdated but not obsolete. With the widespread use of mobile phones and free calling applications that offer unlimited calls via Wi-Fi, traditional landlines may eventually become obsolete. However, the complete phasing out of this technology may take some time. This is because certain regions or countries still contend with unreliable internet or cellular coverage. As of August 2023, Community Phone reports that approximately 40.35 million households in the United States still maintain landline phones, and 38.1 million households have both a landline and a cell phone. For some people, “new” technology doesn’t always mean “better.” On Reddit, a user started a discussion thread asking, “What outdated or obsolete tech are you still using and are perfectly happy with?” The thread received more than 16,000 responses from people who shared the outdated everyday items they still happily use. Check some of them out below.

When writing, Kayla covers topics including lifestyle, pop culture, trending stories, hacks, and urban culture.. Hopefully, social media users who saw Taylor Swift promoting free cookware on platforms like Facebook knew the ads were trouble before they clicked in.

Fake advertisements for the cookware brand Le Creuset, appearing to feature Swift’s stamp of approval, have appeared on Facebook and other social platforms in recent weeks. The advertisements use strewn-together clips of the singer with a synthesized version of her voice and images of Le Creuset Dutch ovens.

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” a fake advertisement featuring Swift’s augmented voice begins. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

The ad then instructs users to click on a button and answer questions in order to receive the brand’s free cookware.

The comments section of the Facebook post featuring Swift’s voice highlighted the various methods that the creators of the false ad used to legitimize the “giveaway.”

“Get in 10 days! Long waiting but anyway the set is great! Thank you guys!!” one account commented.

But other users were quick to jump in and call out the advertisement for being false while also sharing their experience with falling for the advertisement.

“I paid the shipping, stupidly, and never received the cookware,” one user commented. “Shame on me for falling for it. Don’t do it!”

Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Meta tells TODAY.com that the ad has been removed.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” a spokesperson for Le Creuset told NBC News. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

Dr. David S. Touretzky, a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Science Department & Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute, tells TODAY.com that the Le Creuset scam only faked Taylor Swift’s voice.

“The images it used were real,” he explains. “Faking images is possible but requires a lot more work.”

The fake Le Creuset advertisement is far from the first to use artificial intelligence to fake a celebrity’s face or voice for scamming purposes.

Similar scam ads on Facebook show Oprah Winfrey also promoting the cookware giveaway. In November 2023, Scarlett Johansson and her legal team went after Lisa AI, an AI art generator and avatar maker, for using her likeness for online advertisements.

As troubling as these campaigns can be, Touretzky underscores that before deepfakes arrived, people would hire voice impersonators to pull off similar scams.

“But finding people who could both do that well and were willing to facilitate a crime might be difficult. Using computers is easier because they have no morals and won’t rat you out to the authorities,” he continues.

How are deepfake models trained?

Touretzky explains that in order to fake someone’s voice, samples of their speech need to be collected. With Taylor Swift having been everywhere this year, bad actors certainly had plenty of content to pull from.

“You use this as training data for a machine learning algorithm that builds a model of their speech patterns: their pronunciation, intonation, voice timbre, speaking rhythm,” he explains. “Using that model, you can take speech from someone else and transform it so that it sounds like the person you’re trying to imitate.”

How can we protect against deepfakes?

Touretzky notes that there’s no rewinding the clock on deepfake technology.

“The technology isn't going back in the bottle,” he says. “If anything, as computers get more powerful, it will become even more widespread. Maybe in a year or two, you’ll be able to get an app for your phone that lets you speak like Morgan Freeman or Dame Judi Dench.

“Catching people who misuse the technology will have to rely on better ability to trace where the money goes,” he says.. Delish editors handpick every product we feature. We may earn commission from the links on this page.

While the real Taylor Swift would never steer us wrong, her evil twin (read: an AI-generated avatar created by con artists) absolutely would.

According to , unidentified scammers used artificial intelligence and Taylor Swift's likeness to endorse a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway to steal money and data. Though Taylor is, indeed, a fan of Le Creuset, she has no formal deal with the luxury cookware brand despite how it appeared in online videos.

The outlet reports that the fake promotional videos featured an uncanny Swift lookalike that was created with AI technology to replicate her appearance and voice.

"Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here," the AI Swift said in the ad. "Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."

Users were encouraged to click a button on the ad and complete a short survey. They were redirected to legit-seeming websites like The Food Network with fake testimonials on the products, Page Six reports.

And while we don't know who exactly is behind the con, a Facebook account titled "The most profitable shares" posted the Swift scam to its page. Swift's reps have yet to comment on the scandal, however, Le Creuset has released a statement of its own:

"Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."

Just last month, the Better Business Bureau warned the public about these highly-convincing deepfake scams.

"Scammers use deepfake technology to trick people. They take real video clips and photos of a person and use them to create new videos and audio clips. Deepfake images and videos can be surprisingly realistic," the BBB warned in a statement. "Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account. The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you'll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn't exist."

Tom Hanks and CBS Mornings host Gayle King have similarly been used in AI scams, per CBS. According to the outlet, King recently shared a statement to her Instagram account denying claims she is affiliated with the fake weight loss ads circulating the internet with her likeness and told followers not to "be fooled by these AI videos.". Though it seems like Taylor Swift is everywhere — she was named the 2023 Time Magazine Person of the Year, after all — one place we didn't expect to see her name was touting a new collection of cookware.

Fake advertisements using AI technology began surfacing on social media platforms last week, with the singer's likeness telling fans she was working with the famed cookware brand, Le Creuset, to give away Dutch ovens.

"Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free," the fake Swift says in one of the Facebook advertisements, which then prompts viewers to begin a questionnaire and pay for shipping.

After becoming aware of the scam, Meta removed the advertisement and Le Creuset confirmed that the ads were fake.

"Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway," Le Creuset told NBC. "All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset's official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."

Le Creuset Dutch ovens range in price depending on size and color, but the more expensive models can go for upwards of $700.

Swift is not the first celebrity in recent months to have their likeness used for a false advertisement.

In October, actor Tom Hanks took to Instagram to warn fans and followers about a fake dental plan advertisement that was using his image and likeness as part of the promotion.

"BEWARE!! There's a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it," he wrote at the time.

Also in October, mega-influencer Mr. Beast slammed AI deepfakes after his likeness was used for a sham contest encouraging fans to donate to win an iPhone.. A new giveaway scam making rounds on social media is using fake deepfake videos and ads of popstar Selena Gomez to promote free Le Creuset cookware sets. The convincing sponsored posts claim Selena is generously giving away thousands of dollars worth of Le Creuset products to fans absolutely free. However, the entire promotion is an elaborate ruse aimed at stealing users’ money through concealed subscription fees.

This article provides an in-depth examination of how the Selena Gomez Le Creuset Giveaway scam works, the manipulation tactics used, who’s behind it, and most vitally, how to protect yourself online. With advanced deepfake technology making celebrity endorsement scams more prevalent, it’s crucial to be an informed consumer. Keep reading to ensure you don’t get tricked by this fraudulent social media scam.

Overview of the Selena Gomez Le Creuset Giveaway Scam

The Selena Gomez Le Creuset giveaway scam is being heavily promoted across social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube using targeted sponsored ads and posts. These ads leverage realistic-looking deepfake AI video footage of Selena Gomez announcing an urgent giveaway of free Le Creuset cookware sets to her loyal fans.

The convincing deepfake videos show Selena stating that due to a warehouse packing mistake, she has thousands of surplus Le Creuset sets to offload, so she’s giving them away for free to supporters if they act fast. The high-quality AI replication of Selena’s face, voice, and speech patterns make the videos appear very authentic and lure social media users into believing the popstar is genuinely endorsing a free cookware giveaway.

When users click on these enticing social media ads for the free Le Creuset set giveaway, they are redirected to elaborate fake news articles hosted on fraudulent domains posing as trusted mainstream news sites like Fox News, CNN, NBC, and even niche sites like Food Network Magazine.

The deception continues on these fake news sites featuring stolen logos and branding from legitimate networks. The articles reinforce the charade with claims that the giveaway is 100% real and made possible because Selena Gomez wants to urgently award free Le Creuset cookware sets to fans rather than letting excess inventory go to waste.

The fake news articles attribute convincing quotes to Selena herself expressing great excitement for music fans to receive free Le Creuset products thanks to the special exclusivity of the warehouse surplus giveaway. Of course, all quotes are completely fabricated for the sake of the scam.

Near the bottom of the page, the fake articles emphasize interested readers can claim their free Le Creuset cookware set by paying just a small $9.95 or $9.96 shipping and processing fee to cover transportation costs. This is where the scam truly begins.

Users who click the prominent “Claim My Offer” or “Claim Free Cookware Set” buttons featured throughout the fake articles are sent to shady third-party websites to enter payment and personal information. These external sites have no affiliation with Selena Gomez or Le Creuset whatsoever.

Their domains often have vague names like “OnlineProductPromotions”, “LimitedTimeOffers”, or “FreebieWeekly” to continue tricking users that they are part of the legitimate giveaway offer. Stock photos of Le Creuset cookware are used alongside urgent messaging about limited supply remaining.

At this point, victims of the scam must provide sensitive personal and financial information including full name, physical address, email address, phone number, and credit card details. The form reiterates that this is solely to cover the $9.95 shipping and processing costs.

An additional checkbox even states “I understand the ONE TIME shipping fee of $9.95 to receive my free product.” In reality, this payment data is used to enroll users in an expensive monthly subscription they are completely unaware of.

Once victims input their information and submit the $9.95 payment, their credit card is automatically signed up for recurring subscription fees of around $89.95 that will continue indefinitely every month. But the monthly charges are intentionally omitted and disguised by the scam until after users provide their data.

Within 3-5 days of victims submitting their information and making the “shipping” payment, the first $89.95 subscription fee is withdrawn from their account. This is wholly unrelated to the $9.95 upfront cost users paid under the impression it was just for package handling.

The shady third-party websites operate this subscription grift using the credit card details entered by victims when signing up for the purported free cookware deal. The excessive unauthorized monthly $89.95 charges continue being taken from victims’ accounts monthly until they eventually notice what’s happening.

Of course, victims of the scam never end up receiving any free Le Creuset products, cookbooks, or anything else they were promised. The entire premise of the warehouse surplus giveaway is fake and no such association exists between Selena Gomez and the brand.

The solely purpose is deceiving social media users into relinquishing their personal and financial information under false pretenses, and leveraging that data to unknowingly register them for costly monthly subscriptions without consent.

The elaborate scam is able to convince unsuspecting social media users by employing a range of deceptive tactics, including:

Highly realistic deepfake AI video and audio of Selena Gomez announcing the fake giveaway promotion, which tricks users into believing it’s endorsed by her.

Fake advertisements and sponsored posts promoting the giveaway that are made to look like legitimate social media marketing.

Fake news websites impersonating real mainstream news networks with matching branding, logos, and graphics.

Articles populated with fake quotes attributed to Selena expressing excitement around fans receiving free products.

Prominent calls-to-action inviting readers to claim their free set for just a small $9.95 shipping payment.

External domains posing as part of the promotion to harvest user personal and financial data.

Fine print and checkboxes concealing that users are actually being registered for costly monthly subscriptions when submitting payment info rather than a one-time shipping fee.

Omission of any mention regarding monthly recurring charges, terms & conditions, or notification of users’ credit cards being used for ongoing billing.

Lack of any way to cancel, manage, or stop the unwanted subscription charges being applied due to the third-party nature of the shady websites.

Without proper scrutiny, the multiple moving parts of this scam combine seamlessly to deceive users through every stage as they get lured in by the perceived celebrity endorsement, urgency surrounding limited free products, and appeal of only needing to cover a small shipping payment.

In actuality, Selena Gomez has no knowledge of or participation in any such giveaway promotion. Her likeness is being used entirely without consent through deepfake AI technology as part of the elaborate ruse.

Sadly, this scam preys on the trusting nature of Selena Gomez fans and social media users excited by the prospect of scoring expensive Le Creuset cookware totally free. But in reality, victims are signing themselves up to be unwittingly billed monthly subscription fees through by providing their personal and payment data under false pretenses.

The sophisticated scam is able to maintain the charade using the following unethical tactics:

Refusal to provide any working way to cancel, modify, or stop the unauthorized recurring charges from being applied.

Deceptive cancellation and customer service contacts that offer no actual way to halt the subscription billing.

Claiming the monthly fees were always part of agreed upon terms and conditions, banking on most people not reading the dense fine print before signing up.

Citing that the monthly billing is for additional free trial offers, products, or services users had access to after providing their information.

Insisting users violated terms by disputing the fees and threatening punitive legal action or penalties for going against the “agreement”.

Placing crying victims on endless hold times before disconnecting the call to avoid addressing the fraudulent charges.

Outright refusal to issue any refunds or reimbursement for the unauthorized subscription fees deducted on a monthly basis from victims’ accounts.

So in summary, this scam leverages social media ads featuring deepfake videos of Selena Gomez, fake news articles, and urgent limited-time promotion tactics to convince users to provide their personal and financial information under the false belief they will receive free Le Creuset cookware. In reality, they are being signed up for costly monthly subscription plans without consent, operated by shady third-party websites.

These sites continue charging victims’ credit cards exorbitant recurring fees while stonewalling any attempt to cancel the unwanted subscriptions or attain refunds. The scam relies on exploiting the goodwill and fandom of Selena Gomez to lure innocent users into relinquishing sensitive data that allows scammers to unlawfully extract money on an ongoing basis.

Detailed Breakdown of the Scam Process

To fully understand this widespread scam and identify red flags, here is a more in-depth walkthrough of the step-by-step process:

Step 1 – Fake Social Media Ads

The scam begins with sponsored video ads run on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and more. The videos appear to show Selena Gomez casually speaking directly to the camera/audience.

Thanks to deepfake AI technology, the videos match Selena’s face, voice, speech patterns, and mannerisms almost flawlessly. There are no visible or audible signs exposing them as counterfeit.

In the faked videos, Selena explains she has “thousands of surplus sets” left over from a recent Le Creuset photoshoot collaboration. Rather than letting the expensive cookware go to waste, she’s offering it to fans for free on a first come, first served basis.

This fabricated urgency and exclusivity pressures viewers into immediately clicking through to claim their “free” cookware sets.

Step 2 – Fake News Websites

When users click on the promo ads, they are redirected to pseudo news articles made to appear as if published on real sites like Buzzfeed, People, MSN and more. But the lookalike sites are complete scams.

While designed to look convincing at first glance, some red flags include:

Incorrect web URLs (ex. Pe0ple.com vs People.com)

Amateur site design, sloppy text, grammatical errors, and suspicious stock photos

Missing contact pages, broken links, limited navigation menus and options

No legitimate journalist names or sources linked

Still, the sites fool hurried users into believing the false Selena endorsement and urgent giveaway promotion.

The bogus articles reinforce the premise of excess Le Creuset inventory from a photoshoot prompting the special giveaway opportunity. They feature fake quotes from Selena expressing excitement for fans to obtain expensive cookware thanks to this exclusive chance.

The articles emphasize readers must hurry to claim sets before the limited supply runs out. This sense of urgency aims to get users handing over payment info without scrutiny.

Near the bottom, readers are prompted to click “Claim Yours Now!” and cover only a small $10 shipping and handling fee to receive the free Le Creuset items. In truth, this activates unwanted recurring subscription fees.

Step 3 – Submit Personal and Payment Information

When users click the “Claim Yours Now!” buttons eager to score pricey free Le Creuset sets, they are redirected to an online order form on a dubious third-party website completely unaffiliated with Selena or Le Creuset.

These sites have vague names like “OnlineProductPromos”, “LimitedTimeOffersZone” or “MegaDealsHub”. They continue the scam by using Le Creuset branding and faked urgency about limited supply.

To complete their fake “free” order, users must provide personal details like full name, address, email, and phone number. They then must enter credit card information so the $10 shipping costs can be processed.

Nowhere does it reveal this payment data will trigger recurring subscription charges. That critical detail is intentionally omitted until after users submit their information.

Step 4 – Monthly Subscription Charges Begin

Within 3-5 days of providing payment details, victims will experience the first fraudulent subscription withdrawal from their account, usually for excessive amounts like $89.95 or $99.95.

These overpriced monthly fees continue indefinitely until identified and cancelled by users. Of course, victims never receive any free Le Creuset products as originally promised.

Step 5 – Fake Customer Service if You Complain

When defrauded users eventually notice the unauthorized activity on their accounts and contact customer service to complain, they experience pushback and deception. The fraudsters insist monthly fees were clearly agreed to in initial fine print terms.

Their shady tactics include:

Claiming the monthly fee is for unused free trial offers on other sites users joined.

Outright refusing refunds and threatening legal action for “violating” terms.

Placing angry victims on endless holds before disconnecting the call to avoid resolving the issue.

Almost no users can get money back once scammed by one of these celebrity endorsement giveaways. The systems are built to prevent refunds at every stage.

Recognizing Red Flags of the Scam

Now that you understand the step-by-step workings of the Selena Gomez Le Creuset giveaway scam, here are key red flags to recognize as potential signs of a scam:

Too good to be true – Free gifts of brand new expensive merchandise should always arouse suspicion, not excitement. Real freebies aren’t hundred-dollar cookware sets.

– Free gifts of brand new expensive merchandise should always arouse suspicion, not excitement. Real freebies aren’t hundred-dollar cookware sets. Aggressive sales tactics – Pressure to act fast stemming from invented time limits or exclusivity is a common scam tactic. Proceed cautiously when urged to act now.

– Pressure to act fast stemming from invented time limits or exclusivity is a common scam tactic. Proceed cautiously when urged to act now. Poor quality websites – Fake promotion and news pages have obvious signs like bad grammar, strange URLs, and limited menus or contact info. Legitimate organizations invest in quality design.

– Fake promotion and news pages have obvious signs like bad grammar, strange URLs, and limited menus or contact info. Legitimate organizations invest in quality design. Celebrity endorsements – It’s highly suspicious for celebrities to endorse random free giveaways on social media ads. Legit partnerships are announced officially on real websites and social profiles.

– It’s highly suspicious for celebrities to endorse random free giveaways on social media ads. Legit partnerships are announced officially on real websites and social profiles. Requests for unnecessary details – Why would a basic shipping offer need your SSN or online banking passwords? Only scammers ask for more info than reasonably required.

– Why would a basic shipping offer need your SSN or online banking passwords? Only scammers ask for more info than reasonably required. Hard-to-find terms and conditions – If an offer is free and being endorsed publicly, terms governing charges will be stated clearly. Scams bury dubious recurring fees deep in fine print intentionally.

View giveaways skeptically, especially those with celebrities urging you to act fast for an exclusive deal. Verify legitimacy on real brand sites before providing personal or payment data.

What to Do if You Fell Victim to the Scam

If you entered any sensitive information or payment details in relation to a free Selena Gomez Le Creuset promotion, here are the steps to take right away in attempting to get the situation resolved:

Step 1: Contact Your Bank

Contact your credit card provider or bank immediately to report being scammed into an unwanted recurring subscription. Ask them to block any future associated charges. See if any fraudulent fees can be reversed or refunded depending on when entered. Timeliness increases the chance of recovering lost funds. Provide transaction dates and merchant details.

Step 2: Cancel Any Accounts Created

If you created user accounts on any sketchy websites related to the giveaway offer, login and permanently delete or deactivate them. This removes stored payment data from their records, preventing continued billing. Also unsubscribe from any emails you signed up for by using opt-out links.

Step 3: Change Exposed Passwords

Change any passwords you used on the fake promotion sites ASAP if reused elsewhere. Scammers exploit password reuse to access more of your accounts. Enable two-factor authentication for additional security on sensitive logins.

Step 4: Watch for Other Suspicious Charges

Carefully monitor bank statements, credit reports, and all connected accounts over the next few months for any other unusual or bogus charges. Scammers frequently trade and sell stolen personal information online which can lead to additional fraud down the line. Report any dubious activities immediately.

Step 5: Report the Scam

To expedite getting scam sites shut down faster, file details of your experience with:

Federal Trade Commission

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

FBI Anti-Fraud Division

Social Networks the ads appeared on

Le Creuset’s Brand Security team

Local Police Fraud Department

Reporting scams reduces their reach, preventing more victims.

Copyright © AFP 2017-2024. All rights reserved.

Posts purporting to offer free sets of Le Creuset cookware have accumulated thousands of views on Facebook, many claiming Taylor Swift is giving away the enameled cast iron pots to her fans. But the French company told AFP it has never partnered with the pop star, and the advertisements link to websites soliciting money and personal information.

"I got some exciting news to share! I have teamed up with Lé Creuset for another epic gift-away - But this time we're giving away FREE 20 piece cookware sets!" said a January 2, 2024 Facebook post sharing a video of Swift, which has since been removed.

In the clip, the singer appeared to say: "Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So, I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."

Cookware sets from Le Creuset retail for more than $1,000, making the possibility of a freebee attractive. But the link in the post for "Taylor Swift's BIG New Year Giveaway" led to an unrelated website.

Other posts link to a supposed Food Network article about the promotion. However, AFP found no such article on the cable channel's website -- and a spokesperson said the promotion is "in no way connected to the Food Network brand."

Links in the fake article lead to a series of survey questions requesting personal information and a payment that supposedly covers shipping costs for the "free" product.

Asked about the ads, the French cookware company told AFP: "Le Creuset has never partnered with Taylor Swift for any partnership to offer gifts to consumers."

Le Creuset does use social media to offer giveaways (archived here), but it said all promotions will come from official, verified profiles.

"It is always advisable to check the official Le Creuset social accounts and website before clicking on a suspicious ad," the company said in a French statement.

Widespread scam tactic

A keyword search for "Le Creuset giveaway" on Facebook surfaced more offers for free cookware purportedly sponsored by Oprah Winfrey, country music star Trisha Yearwood and US television hosts Joanna and Chip Gaines.

"This is a scam," said Katie Keil, director of public relations at Magnolia, the lifestyle company founded by the Gaines.

In a January 16 email, she told AFP the company did not permit the use of Joanna or Chip Gaines's likeness in the ads -- and that the couple does "not have a sponsorship deal" with Le Creuset.

Meta's Ad Library shows other alleged offers from singers Selena Gomez, Lainey Wilson and Miranda Lambert -- as well as blogger Ree Drummond, known as the Pioneer Woman. The videos claim the cookware is free due to a "packaging error."

AFP contacted representatives for Swift and other celebrities for comment, but responses were not forthcoming.

The US Better Business Bureau warns consumers that artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an increase in accounts using celebrity impersonations to promote unaffiliated products.

Cybersecurity firm McAfee said January 10 on X that it had confirmed the video of Swift was a "deepfake scam generated through AI" (archived here). The New York Times reported the clips were likely created using an AI text-to-speech tool.

The ads contain several other clues that they are inauthentic:

The celebrities' lips do not sync with their supposed statements.

Some posts misspelled the company's name.

Most of the pages sponsoring the ads were recently created, according to their Page Transparency information.

The pages are not verified and have few followers or public posts.

Users have commented on several posts warning others the offer is not legitimate.

AFP previously reported news anchors in several countries have seen their likenesses used in AI-generated ads promoting spurious offers. AFP has also debunked investment schemes falsely linked to Elon Musk.

January 16, 2024 This article was updated to add a response from Katie Keil at the Magnolia company.

January 11, 2024 This article was updated to add that some posts misspell the company's name.. This latest AI scandal might be the most absurd I've seen so far. In a recent ad circulating on social media, popstar Taylor Swift was seen promoting a giveaway for Le Creuset cookware – a collaboration that the brand has since denied.

While AI can help improve our lives, rapid artificial intelligence advancements also allow deepfake scams to become increasingly sophisticated. So to clarify, no, that wasn't Taylor flogging a few spare casserole dishes, it was a deceptive (and slightly ridiculous) AI scam.

McAfee Advisory! No, That’s Not Taylor Swift Promoting Le Creuset Cookware.If you see this video in your social media feed, we can confirm that it is a #deepfake scam generated through #AI.McAfee's Project Mockingbird technology announced at #CES2024, is designed to empower… pic.twitter.com/aVpcjI0PgkJanuary 10, 2024 See more

With a crafty blend of deepfake technology, old footage and text-to-speech software, the fraudulent ads produced a somewhat convincing result that could easily deceive an unsuspecting fan. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here," the fake Taylor says in a monotonous voice. "Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free,” she adds.

While it might seem strange, it's not a completely far-fetched collaboration, as Swift previously flexed her Le Creuset crockpot in the Miss Americana documentary. She's also not shy of a brand collaboration, previously partnering with companies like CoverGirl and Coca-Cola. While those of us who are more familiar with AI-generated content might identify the video's robotic twinge, these scams aim to play on vulnerable fans, scamming them for money with a Swiftie facade.

With Meta's celebrity AI chatbots blurring the lines between celebs and the public, it feels like we're edging closer to a parasocial crisis, creating an environment ripe for fraudulent scams. At least now that the Swift scam has been debunked we can see the more ridiculous side. For more AI news, take a look at the bizarre AI human generator that's astounding (and a little terrifying).. Over the last several weeks, a series of ads have appeared on Facebook featuring Taylor Swift’s voice encouraging “Swifties” to sign up to receive free Le Creuset cookware sets, all they had to do was click a link and provide some information about themselves.

While, as the New York Times reports, Swift is a fan of the brand — her collection has appeared in the background of the several Tumblr and Instagram accounts dedicated to her home decor — the advertisement was actually a scam. It was created using artificial intelligence technology that mimicked the singer’s voice, which was then laid over slips of Le Creuset Dutch ovens.

Swift is not the only celebrity whose AI-generated likeness has been used to sell products; as Salon reported in October, AI versions of Tom Hanks and the late Robin Williams have also been used without their consent.

Per the New York Times, “Le Creuset said it was not involved with the singer for any consumer giveaway” while representatives for Taylor Swift did not offer comment.. A new ad featuring an AI-generated Taylor Swift offering a giveaway of high-end cookware is not the real deal.

An ad for Le Creuset appeared on social media this month, featuring a likeness of Swift and a fake version of her voice with images of the company’s cookware to promote a giveaway, according to multiple outlets.

"Hey you all, it’s Taylor Swift here," the voice says, according to NBC News. "Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free."

A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, confirmed to Fox News Digital that the ad has been removed from the platform.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Le Creuset confirmed to Fox News Digital in a statement that neither they nor Swift were involved in the ad.

"Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."

Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

AI expert Marva Bailer noted that whoever created the ad "may be using AI, but a human made the choice to risk their reputation, consumer loyalty or their job by allowing ads that do not have contractual rights for endorsement. The idea that the picture is ‘entertainment,’ or this is for ‘fun’ does not equate in the world of business and brands. Marketing agencies and professionals for the most part are aware of these requirements."

She continued, "With the age of AI, artificial intelligence, the barrier to entry to create and disseminate content is not limited to professionals. Free tools that create professional images and campaigns are launched in minutes reaching global audiences of millions. The ‘meme’ culture of creating context for entertainment changes drastically when the content is used to represent brands and commerce without legal consent."

Bailer explained that with the tools available and their rapid evolution, "The speed at which content is created and consumed is estimated at 4,000-10,000 ads per day. With our attention span of 8-seconds, less than that of a goldfish, it presents opportunities for fake ads to slip through. AI is leveraged to understand preferences and increase personalization. [There is] potential to create fake reviews to show interest, create visuals that show use of the product that are imaginary. The promise of happiness, beauty tied to a great deal and the quick press of the button may leave consumers disappointed."

Swift is just the latest celebrity who’s had their likeness used without permission by an AI-generated ad.

ROBIN WILLIAMS’ DAUGHTER, AND TOM HANKS, KEIRA KNIGHTLEY AMONG STARS FIGHTING AGAINST AI

Last year, actor Tom Hanks took to social media to warn fans that an ad using his name and likeness was a scam.

"There's a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it," he wrote, signing his name in a post on Instagram.

Actress Scarlett Johansson planned to pursue legal action against an AI image-generating app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar for her voice and likeness in an ad posted on X, formerly Twitter.

Johansson’s lawyer told Variety, "We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have."

In the ad, posted on Oct. 28 but apparently no longer available, footage of Johansson behind the scenes on "Black Widow" is used, where she says, "What’s up guys? It’s Scarlett and I want you to come with me …" before a graphic covers her mouth and the screen shows AI-generated images that resemble her.

There was fine print under the ad that read, "Images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person."

Celebrities, or anyone having their likeness and voice used without permission, may have legal recourse in the future.

According to Bloomberg Law, a proposed "No Fakes Act" was released in October as a discussion draft by a bipartisan group of senators.

The penalties include a fine of $5,000 per violation and any economic damages that can be proven in court.. Taylor Swift may get a lot of airtime at NFL games and award shows, but that doesn't mean you should believe it when you see her selling cookware on social media. In the internet's latest “Wait, what?” moment, the iconic singer has found herself the subject of an insidious AI scam.

AI deepfake technology has gotten a little too good over the years, leading to a wide range of celebrity doppelgangers being used to scam unsuspecting users out of their online data and personal finances.

Now, one featuring the famous “Anti-hero” singer's likeness is being used to sell Le Creuset products to unsuspecting users on social media. As if anyone needed another reason to splurge on artisan cookware during a global economic crisis.. What do you get when you cross a premium cookware brand with the name and likeness of a music megastar? A classic giveaway scam. We’ve been tracking the Le Creuset Taylor Swift giveaway scam this week as it’s spread like wildfire across social media and multiple news outlets. Let’s dive in for the low-down.

What Is the Le Creuset Taylor Swift Giveaway Scam?

Scams and fake giveaways are common on social media platforms, especially Facebook. Scammers often use the names of popular celebrities or brands to trick people into losing their money or providing personal information, such as credit card details. In this case, AI-generated deepfake videos portray a fake Taylor Swift, who has supposedly teamed up with Le Creuset to commence a PR giveaway campaign.

The AI woman states: “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here […] Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”



Needless to say, it is not true — there is no giveaway team-up between the two parties. It’s not known who is behind the scam, but “The most profitable shares” is one such Facebook page that has been spreading the scam. If you come across these ads or this page, stay away. There are red flags regarding this page: created just this month, no admin information, and no likes or followers. The page is clearly just a vehicle for spreading the scam. Below is another ad from the same page, this time just focusing on Le Creuset.

If you have come across a giveaway that seems too good to be true, be skeptical. Legitimate giveaways are typically hosted on verified, official social media accounts of celebrities or brands. To be safe, you should check the official social media accounts of related parties for any announcements or promotions. In addition, be cautious when clicking on links, providing personal information, or making financial transactions. These scams are increasingly common, with the likes of Tom Hanks and Gayle King also targeted for deepfake videos. As the Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns:

“Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account […] The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you’ll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn’t exist.”

I KNEW YOU WERE TROUBLE Taylor Swift fan warning after pop megastar’s voice is deepfaked for bogus ads offering giveaway – signs to watch for

A HIGH-END cookware line has said they are not affiliated with an AI-generated ad involving a Taylor Swift deep fake.

Le Creuset, a popular cookware brand, said they are not responsible for the ad circulating the internet that is using Taylor Swift's likeness by deepfaking her voice.

In the ad, Swift's voice is played over shots of Le Creuset cookware and talking headshots of the pop star.

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” said the deepfake voice, reports NBC News.

“Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

The scam ad was originally posted on Facebook by a page titled "The most profitable shares."

The ad has garnered over 2,300 views.

Le Creuset released a statement that said they were not involved with the fake ad.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” the statement read.

“All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts."

The statement continued: "Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

Although AI deepfake technology has been around for quite some time, the ease with which people's likenesses may be replicated without their consent has raised fresh concerns.

And this is not the first time a celebrity's image and likeness have been illegally used in an AI-generated ad.

When an AI-generated image of Scarlett Johansson appeared in an online advertisement in November, her legal team demanded a cease and desist from Lisa AI software.

The software aimed to create stylized avatars based on real images of individuals.

In another instance, YouTube Star MrBeast's image and likeness were used as a deep fake to advertise an iPhone 15 giveaway.

The U.S. Sun has reached out to Le Creuset for comment.. Fraudsters created a deepfake ad using Taylor Swift's likeness in a bid to scam her fans out of money.

The AI-generated ad, which had been circulating online earlier this month, promoted a non-existent giveaway between the popstar and Le Creuset cookware.

The advert featured a synthetic version of Swift's voice, spliced with footage of her and Le Creuset dutch ovens, saying: 'Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free.'

Customers who clicked on the ad, which has since been removed from Facebook, would then be directed to websites mimicking popular homegoods platforms like Food Network, according to the New York Times.

Sweepstakes participants would then be asked to pay a 'small shipping fee of $9.96' to receive their free cookware. After providing payment, consumers were reportedly hit with monthly charges and never received the cooking set.

Le Creuset said that it is not collaborating with Swift, 34, on any consumer giveaways and encouraged shoppers to get its official social media accounts before clicking on adverts.

Taylor Swift is known to have an affinity for the high-end cookware brand. Le Crueset shared a photo of her cooking on its Facebook page in 2020 noting how its dutch ovens made a cameo appearance (pictured) in her Netflix documentary Miss Americana

The ad appears to have originally been posted on a Facebook page titled The most profitable shares.

The deepfaked version of Swift told 'Swifties', the phrase used to describe her fans, that she was 'thrilled' to be giving away free Le Creuset sets.

After announcing the giveaway, the AI-generated Swift directed viewers to complete immediately complete a survey to collect their prize, noting that 'supplies are running out'.

The ad had amassed around 2,300 views before it was taken off down. A spokesperson for Meta, the platform's parent company, confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that it had removed the ad.

Le Creuset denied any affiliation with the promotion, telling MailOnline: 'Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway.

'All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset's official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.'

AI experts believe the ad was likely created using a text-to-speech service that translates a script into a synthetic voice. The faked audio can then be incorporated into already existing video clips using lip-syncing programs.

There is no suggestion that Swift is linked to the ad in any way. The Anti-Hero singer is pictured arriving for dinner at hotspot Lucali in Brooklyn, New York City on Wednesday

'These tools are becoming very accessible these days,' Dr Siwei Lu, a computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, told the New York Times. 'It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.'

Dr Lu added that AI technology allows users to create a 'decent-quality video' in under 45 minutes.

There is no suggestion that Swift is linked to the ad in any way despite the Anti-Hero singer being known to have an affinity for the high-end cookware brand.

Actress Jamie King gifted Swift a Le Creuset set as a housewarming gift in 2014. The singer was also seen in a kitchen using the brand's wares in her Netflix documentary Miss Americana (2020).

Meta and a spokesperson for Swift did not immediately respond to MailOnline's requests for comment.

Swift is the latest celebrity to be targeted by a deep fake ad. Last October, actor Tom Hanks warned his social media followers that his likeness was being used to promote 'some dental plan' that he had 'nothing to do with'.

TV personality Gayle King made a similar post one day after Hanks warning her fans that an AI deep fake had been created to promote a hawk product that she was not endorsing.

The fraudsters used a recent video that King had posted to promote her radio show, but dubbed it over with synthetic audio. The TV star told her followers 'not to be fooled' by the ad.

It comes as a new report has warned that AI-driven fake news threatens to disrupt global elections, risking violence and jeopardizing Press freedom.

The spread of misinformation was named as the biggest risk for the next two years according to a poll of 1,400 business leaders and experts.

Developments in artificial intelligence make it harder to tell the difference between computer-generated content, such as deepfake videos, and reality.. . Bad actors are using the Le Creuset giveaway scam to trick people into giving their credit card information. How do they do that? Of course, by using celebrity identities to trick people into believing that the Le Creuset giveaway scam is legit. However, it is not.

Have you heard about the latest scam sweeping the internet? It’s all about a fake giveaway of Le Creuset cookware, and guess what? It’s got Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez’s names all over it! But, before you get too excited, let us tell you, it’s a big, fat scam. Yep, you heard it right. These clever tricksters have been using AI to make videos that look and sound just like our beloved celebs. They’re saying things like, “I’m so excited to give away free Le Creuset sets!” But here’s the catch: it’s all a lie.

Don’t fall for the Le Creuset giveaway scam

These videos popped up all over Meta (the folks behind Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok. And they look so real! But, the real kicker? They’re not just using Taylor and Selena’s faces. They’re deepfaking them. That’s a fancy way of saying they’re using high-tech AI to copy their voices, facial expressions, and even the way they talk. And boy, does it look convincing.

Now, these sneaky ads have links that take you to websites that seem totally legit. They look like they’re from the Food Network or other big names in the news world. They lure you in with promises of “free” Le Creuset goodies for just a tiny shipping fee of $9.96. But here’s where it gets nasty. People who tried to get their free set ended up with no cookware. Instead, they got slapped with an $89.95 monthly subscription on top of that “shipping” fee.

Swifties, Selenators, and more celebrity fans are the targets

The main victims of this scam? Fans of celebrities. These fake ads are all over social media, targeting fans of Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and others, says Engadget. They show videos of these stars saying they’re giving away Le Creuset products for free. But remember, it’s all a setup.

The list of impersonated stars includes:

Lainey Wilson

Is the Le Creuset giveaway legit

No, the Le Creuset giveaway is not legit. Bad actors from some parts of the world are using AI-generated deepfake videos of your favorite singer and actors to trick you into giving them your credit card information. Please be cautious against these kinds of scam attempts, as they are certainly not legit.

What is deepfake?

Deepfakes are a big deal in the tech world. They use high-end AI to create videos or audio that mimic real people. It’s like digital copying but very advanced. The AI studies how someone talks and moves then make a video where it looks like that person is doing something they never really did. It’s hard to tell them apart from real videos; they’re becoming more common.

Deepfakes, like this cookware giveaway, can be used for harmless jokes or serious scams. As the technology improves, it’s getting tougher to spot the fakes.

What to do against deepfake scams?

So, what can you do to stay safe from these scams? First, be wary of offers that seem unreal. If a famous person is apparently giving away expensive items for nothing, it’s likely a scam. Do some checking. Look at the celebrity’s or brand’s real social media. If there’s a genuine giveaway, they’ll talk about it there. Also, be careful with websites that look strange or have odd web addresses.

Your personal information is valuable. Don’t share your credit card details or personal info unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe. And if you see a deepfake or scam, report it. This helps platforms like Facebook and TikTok fight these scams, but they need us to help find them.

In summary, stay alert and skeptical. Don’t let things like the Le Creuset giveaway scam fool you. You can protect yourself from these clever but deceptive tricks by being cautious and informed!

Taylor Swift has become the latest victim of AI-generated fake ads

Taylor Swift fans scammed by AI-generated Le Creuset endorsements

By Divya Raje Bhonsale 12:42 pm Jan 10, 202412:42 pm

What's the story In the increasing list of AI-generated scams, fraudsters have now produced counterfeit advertisements featuring Taylor Swift for a high-end cookware brand Le Creuset. The ads, created using Swift's deepfake video and AI-generated voice, tricked her fans into parting with their money and personal information. These deceptive endorsements had been spread across social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok, imitating the pop star.

Context

Why does this story matter?

The impersonations of celebrities using AI tools are on the rise. Recently, Hollywood icon Jimmy Stewart's voice was recreated by a voice-cloning startup Respeecher, using a voice actor. Similarly, Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson have also been victims of voice-cloning in the past. Johansson also sued an app by the name of Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar for using her voice and face in its ad.

Details

Fake ads claimed Swift was giving away free cookware sets

In these bogus ads, the AI-created Swift excitedly offers to give away free Le Creuset cookware sets to her followers, known as Swifties. It urged the users to click on a button and answer a few questions before the day ended. Upon clicking the link, they got directed to seemingly authentic websites, such as the Food Network, showcasing fabricated customer reviews and false news stories about the product.

The scam

Fans scammed to pay hidden monthly charges

Once the user(s) is on the link, they were scammed into paying a "small shipping fee of $9.96" for the cookware. Eventually, they end up paying a concealed monthly charge while never receiving the promised Le Creuset pot. Dr. Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor, informed the New York Times that it takes under 45 minutes to generate a "decent-quality" video using AI tools, which are becoming increasingly available.

AI-generated scams

Other celebrities who were targets of such scams

Swift isn't the only celebrity targeted in such cons. Country singer Lainey Wilson, interior designer Joanna Gaines, and lifestyle blogger Ree Drummond have also reportedly been implicated in similar scams. Meanwhile, Le Creuset confirmed they were running no such deals, and had no association with Swift. They further urged consumers to buy products from their official website, further cautioning them against clicking on dubious ads.. The video shows Ree Drummond doing a giveaway for Le Creuset cookware, but she says the video is fake and that AI generated her voice to create the ad.

Scammers can also use the videos to collect your personal information and experts warn you should never click any links connected to videos that look suspicious.

The FTC says these videos are becoming more and more popular, and it's harder to tell what's real and what's fake.

Actor Tom Hanks has spoken on social media about an AI video created of him doing a dental commercial, and CBS Mornings host Gayle King shared about a video created of her endorsing a medical supplement.

Experts say sometimes you can watch the person's mouth to see if it matches up to what they are saying.. A fraudulent online campaign claiming beloved Food Network host Ree Drummond has collaborated with Le Creuset for an epic holiday giveaway has infiltrated social media through manipulated advertisements and questionable external websites. However, the supposed cookware freebie offer intends stealing users’ personal and financial information rather than reasonable celebrity product charity. This article exposes the systematic deception strategies such appliance scams employ to financially exploit individuals alongside protection guidance avoiding potential damages.

Scam Overview

This increasingly common scam starts circulating online ads run across popular platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These feature deepfake AI video content portraying Ree Drummond enthusiastically explaining an exclusive seasonal deal gifting free Le Creuset cookware sets to fans who enter quickly enough:

“Hey y’all, Ree Drummond here with some exciting news!” exclaims the simulated promotional spots. “To spread some holiday cheer this year, I’ve teamed up with Le Creuset to give away a few of their gorgeous Dutch ovens totally FREE to some of my most supportive fans and followers!”

The fabricated Pioneer Woman representation urges viewers act fast through integrated links supposedly revealing voucher ownership details for securing the expensive kitchenwares simply covering minor $10 shipping labels appearing reasonable reconciliation good-cause holiday gestures demonstrating celebrity generosity expecting little reciprocation beyond fair logistic costs in return.

However, users then get rerouted outside social media to various elaborate intermediate phishing websites completely unassociated with Le Creuset or the real celebrity talent.

Decoy portal pages like “cookwareworldusa.com” showcase the Le Creuset logo alongside fake news articles depicting the epic giveaway covered by major outlets. Website headers trumpet unbelievable headlines implying coveted products remain available still if acting quickly enough:

“Only 8 Free Le Creuset Cookware Sets Left Thanks to Overwhelming Interest from Ree Drummond Followers – Learn More About Nationwide Giveaway Now Before It’s Too Late!”

This aims overcoming initial skepticism around the scam justifying requests later asking sensitive customer payment and personal data rather than raising red flags over such unbelievable free merchandise requiring so little initial investment.

After scrolling through fake dwindling inventory alerts and customer testimonials, visitors reach customized order forms promising delivery of the pricey cookware sets solely pending small $9.95 upfront shipping/handling fees appearing reasonable logistics costs reconciliation typical e-commerce voucher-based giveaway promotions.

However hidden subscription clauses discreetly authorize expensive unauthorized recurring monthly charges from shady partners rather than reasonable one-time payments expected under $10 limit disclosed publicly.

In the end, victims receive no high-end Le Creuset cooking products actually promised long term. But compromised confidential information enables scammers inflicting significant financial damages through underground data sale channels thanks to unlocked credit card or account access carelessly handed over initially chasing extraordinary holiday deals seeming too good ignoring.

How the Scam Works

The fraudulent Ree Drummond Le Creuset giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims through an elaborate deceptive process preying vulnerabilities even among vigilant individuals:

Step 1) Build Hype With Deepfake Celebrity Endorsement Videos

The scam starts using AI deepfake generated videos falsely portraying Ree Drummond enthusiastically endorsing the holiday Le Creuset giveaway for fans. Her familiar Food Network personality recognition builds initial social hype and wider reach to amplify fraudulent conversion ratios scaling at unprecedented levels later.

Step 2) Direct Traffic Through Elaborate External Phishing Pages

Clicking those fabricated endorsement videos and captions sends viewers outside social media ecosystems rerouting victims through polished intermediate portal pages like “cookwareworldusa.com” impersonating reputable brands. These feature more Drummond imagery alongside situational backstories and limited-time promotion details overcoming skepticism at scale.

Step 3) Create Urgency and Social Proof Incentivizing Desired Actions

Fake dwindling inventory alerts and dubious customer reviews further compel reactively seeking scarce free goods rather than questioning contradictory abnormalities.

“Only 8 free Le Creuset sets still remain thanks overwhelming demand from Ree’s fans!” warnings pressure visitors. “Hurry and claim yours before it’s too late!”

Step 4) Covertly Collect Users’ Financial Information and Personal Data

Customized online order forms under guise securing contest entries conveniently require private sensitive input exceeding reasonable needs justifying free cookware shipment logistics alone. Required details extend beyond contact information increasing risks enabling supplementary data exploitations and direct financial injuries.

Step 5) Hide Recurring Charges in Fine Print Disclosures

Buried deep within lengthy website terms and conditions passages reveal unwitting victims actually consent authorizing steep unexpected recurring monthly credit card charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time $10 product shipment costs depicted consistently across earlier advertisement materials.

Step 6) Continuously Profit From Stolen Data and Recurring Theft

With widespread access provided through compromised confidential information, recurring bank account and/or credit card charges soon activate allowing scammers collecting payments long after victims realize promised expensive Le Creuset sets will never arrive.

And compromised personal data further enables potential resale through unregulated dark web black market channels – each vector inflicting additional long-term financial and privacy damages upon manipulation victims falling for fictional celebrity-fronted contests leaving them utterly empty-handed.

In summary, the celebrity affiliated appliance scam ensnares social media users through emotional triggers, psychological pressure, urgency cues and concealed terms disclosing unreasonable recurring financial extraction objectives unrelated to initial marketing transparency first pitched for PR perception management.

How To Spot the Ree Drummond Le Creuset Giveaway Scam on Social Platforms

In addition to external fraudulent websites, the supposed Ree Drummond free Le Creuset giveaway also flows heavily through major social channels like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated video content and psychological tactics deceiving users.

Let’s review what signals commonly expose the questionable cookware promotion on each platform.

Facebook Tactics Exploiting the Le Creuset Giveaway

Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common problems:

Video advertisements using deepfake celebrity media endorsing free Le Creuset sets

Links in unpaid posts and descriptions rerouting outside Facebook to unvetted domains

Profiles spreading hype demonstrate very limited previous activities

Comments emphasize contest excitement rather than reasonably questioning abnormalities

For example, deepfake spots claiming Ree Drummond facilitated Le Creuset gifts deserve scrutiny before engagement.

Suspicious Instagram Approaches Promoting Cookware Scams

Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to free Le Creuset offers:

Ree Drummond tagged in unrelated side accounts she didn’t create herself

Captions urge immediate actions through risky external links to “claim” prizes

Profiles discuss only contest details without expected personal sharing

Locations list foreign countries unrelated to known U.S. corporate operations

Specifically, any Instagram post pretending affiliation with Ree Drummond’s authorized contests deserves reasonable vetting before proceeding.

Dangerous TikTok Videos Promoting Appliance Scams

Apply extra caution towards TikTok videos exhibiting these problems:

Sophisticated deepfake edits depicting Ree Drummond endorsing free Le Creuset sets

Links in captions route clicking traffic outside platform protections

Uniformly positive comments focused exclusively on urgent participation

Strong calls-to-action incentivize rapidly reacting contradicting logic vetting

If you spot an oddly persuasive video diverting outside links seemingly too good believing, independently verify authenticity first. Across all social channels, supposed celebrity-tied opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain warrant reasonable inspection before participation, protecting oneself from preventable damages later. What seems too good often is until proven otherwise. Maintain healthy skepticism.

How to Spot the Scam Websites

In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity cookware scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites helping lend false credibility justifying requests for sensitive user payment information and data later.

Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincingly professional first impressions.

Impersonating Reputable News Brands Without Consent

Fraudulent portal pages deliberately display stolen logos from established media authorities like Fox News, ABC or People Magazine without permission. This duplicitous tactic aims duping initial visitors into assuming previous journalistic review vetting unbelievable sweepstakes authenticity.

Fabricating Favorable Celebrity Endorsement Content

Another effective trick giving illusion of third-party credibility involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes and imagery praising the epic holiday cookware giveaway. But further inspection reveals no records correlating the messages to any actual endorsement press releases.

For example, sites proclaim:

“I can’t wait to see fans unboxing their gorgeous new Le Creuset Dutch ovens this season after entering my huge giveaway!” says a falsely attributed Ree Drummond quote used without permission.

This intends lowering visitor guard for later requesting financial disclosures rather than reasonable transparency offering merchandise in exchange for little initial investment.

Burying Fine Print Legalese Detailing Recurring Account Charges

While prominent graphics prompt urgent participation scarcely reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages reveal victims registering for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices as depicted repeatedly earlier. This clearly demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus transparency around contests.

So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected celebrity status tempt engagement on surface levels, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages consistently. Carefully assess emotional hooks against objective facts revealing contradictory details when analyzed deeper beyond initial impressions.

What To Do If You Are A Victim of The Fake Ree Drummond Giveaway

If now facing unexpected recurring bank or credit charges after attempting questionable free online contests, immediately take the following consumer protection actions:

Step 1) Alert Financial Institutions About Detected Fraudulent Activity

Promptly contact all pertinent payment providers and banking institutions regarding recent discovery of an appliance promotion scam falsely claiming Ree Drummond endorsement used as pretext enabling undisclosed account billing lacking proper consent.

Ask urgently about launching fraud disputes and request temporary reimbursements until full investigations around malicious business practices conclude. Supply providers further details on offending business names, domains or parent companies behind recurring fees so appropriate internal alerts register preventing additional vulnerable households falling victim.

Follow their guidance strengthening disputes demonstrating measurable financial damages incurred under demonstrated intentionally deceptive circumstances.

Step 2) Attempt Canceling All Related Subscription or Account Accesses

Collect specific customer service contact information from monthly billing statements tied to scam services legally needing cessation after terms disclosed publicly contradict reality.

Thoroughly call each provider clearly stating you entirely revoke authorization and contest previously confirmed agreements initially unaware those situations took unfair advantage through predatory concealment rather than reasonable giveaway disclosures depicted around merely securing free Le Creuset merchandise requiring only reasonable shipping.

Record cancellation confirmation details should charges persist anyway which remains common dealing with untrustworthy anonymous operators demonstrating repeatedly already their unwillingness respecting victims’ rights issuing refunds after taking money originally through celebrate charity premise.

Step 3) Enable Extra Account Protection Measures Moving Forward

Since some personally identifiable information or account credentials were already compromised initially by scammers focused solely self-interest rather than reasonably community goodwill, immediately change passwords, update security answers and enable stronger multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible across pertinent logins to protect further exposure risks going forward.

Proactively contact credit bureaus regarding additional card lock notifications for any unauthorized opening attempts made deceitfully leveraging previously stolen data further than already financially injured. Always remain vigilant with extensive account monitoring enabling quicker fraud interventions minimizing greatly expanded identity theft and privacy invasion damages from past scam participation vulnerable points taken granted reasonably elsewhere originally until proved contrary.

Step 4) Lodge Extensive Complaint Reports with Consumer Protection Groups

File complete detailed reports about all offending companies, scam portal URLs and measurable financial damages clearly incurred under false pretenses initially portrayed surrounding product giveaways with both government and third-party agencies like state Attorney General, FTC, and BBB documenting what events occurred voluntarily any evidence helping investigations proving repeated demonstrable fraud patterns staff review later when considering applying pressure corporate policy changes assisting recovery outcomes.

Provide all available website names, header images displaying unauthorized trademark usage alongside celebrity media used facilitating initial deception that granted perceived legitimacy luring participation. The more precise details submitted helpSPEEDING EXPOSUREPROCESSES warning larger sections general population through media channels or credit alert notifications eventually made after reasonable complaints aggregated assessing substantial threats existing current practices left unregulated.

Recognizing Red Flags Exposing The Fake Ree Drummond Giveaway

While highly convincing social media campaigns centered around breakthrough cooking celebrity holiday generosity themed promotions, several consistent suspicious signals help quickly reveal when specialized contests and gift offers likely intend predatory outcomes rather than reasonable philanthropic marketing gimmicks ultimately:

1. Unauthorized Celebrity or Brand Affiliation Claims

Despite advertisements directly stating or falsely suggesting sponsorship affiliations, further inspection clearly lacks evidence across Ree Drummond publicist statements or Food Network’s PR team verifying recent massive Le Creuset giveaway events depicted consistently targeting followers online currently. Extremely serious legal concerns arise from unauthorized usage broadcasting celebrity likeness and trademarks essentially doubling-down committing deliberate fraud after initial alleged bait-switch damages.

2. Urgency Creation Tactics Incentivizing Haste Over Logic

The deployment of manufactured urgency triggers like ticking countdowns and claims around extremely limited supply unit deadlines predominantly aim manipulating emotions sufficient levels short-circuiting critical due diligence considerations crucially prudent before relinquishing sensitive personal data or financial information.

3. Highly Suspicious Urgent Promotion Account Activities

User profiles spreading significant hype around these time-sensitive contests often demonstrate very limited genuine platform activity histories bringing doubts why sudden out-of-character promotional marketing flooded their feeds first now regarding this exclusive opportunity alone.

4. Intermediate External Website Redirect Funnels

Embedded links sending follower traffic outside legitimate social media platform ecosystems detach users from internal moderation protections and ditch them into externally uncontrolled unreliable environments with greater ideals fostering predatory financial scams wanting zero public accountability before during after initial bait-n-switch delivered.

5. Monthly Subscription Charges Buried in Fine Print Terms

Recurring $100+ monthly fee structures electively buried many pages deep within lengthy website terms and conditions disclosures greatly contradict reasonable expectations from straightforward initial advertisements seemingly promising completely free merchandise or reasonable one-time shipping costs around $10 instead. This represents knowing intentions eliciting finances through deception rather than reasonably good-faith free gift offers tied closely holiday themes warmth.

By recognizing these and other suspicious patterns early, prudent individuals remain better positioned avoiding otherwise preventable privacy and financial damages associated with scrutinizing unbelievable celebrity-endorsed product gift offers before ever confirming participation or enabling sensitive data exposure through intentional design mechanisms aimed transferring money unethically from misled victims into offshore accounts controlled by bad actors rather than reasonably providing any legitimate public services giving back.

Frequently Asked Questions About The Viral Ree Drummond Cookware Scam

Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions regarding supposed Ree Drummond sponsored Le Creuset holiday giveaway promotions currently circulating social media and suspicious external websites.

Is the Ree Drummond Le Creuset giveaway real or fake?

Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seemingly showing Drummond endorsing an extraordinary Le Creuset giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam effort aiming to phish peoples’ payment credentials and personal information rather than donate expensive cookware free to random individuals.

No reputable evidence suggests authenticity behind promotions.

What techniques do Le Creuset scammers use to appear real?

This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely depicting Drummond endorsing the giveaway alongside imagery showing her baking holiday treats inside Le Creuset branded Dutch ovens.

Additionally, elaborate external portal pages mimic reputable news brand logos alongside urgency cues encouraging desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions disclosures also bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering one-time product shipment costs estimated around $10.

Why would Ree Drummond do a nationwide Le Creuset contest?

No logical reason explains a celebrity randomly gifting total strangers $400+ cookware sets simply covering minor shipping logistics alone. It reasonably makes little sense.

While certainly possible someday in future, supposed existing viral Le Creuset contests fronted by Ms. Drummond instead likely represent third-party scam attempts trying to falsely suggest advocacy towards subtly causing preventable financial harm rather than reasonable goodwill.

What actually happens after attempting fake Ree Drummond cookware order forms?

Despite flashy social media incentives promising free high-end Le Creuset sets to fans attempting order processes, unfortunate victims never receive devices.

However, buried terms forms reveal accidentally consenting signing up for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time product shipment fees depicted initially.

What immediate steps should appliance scam victims take?

Those discovering unauthorized charges appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity product giveaways should first urgently notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions related scam discovery requesting assistance.

Shutdown compromised account access risks then report details naming businesses behind such practices to appropriate fraud reporting groups exposing schemes faster warning public stopping continuous financial victimization vulnerabilities often targeting households.

Guidance On Avoiding Celebrity-Fronted Appliance Scams

The key guidance for dodging predatory scams parading as famous figure tied holiday markdown offers include:

1. Independently Verify Legitimacy Through Unbiased Third Party Source Vetting

If all-too generous promotions seem reasonably questionable, thoroughly vet key endorsement claims around sponsorships, corporate backers, product availability and entry mechanisms through impartial objective authoritative sources before acting or enabling data access. Essentially check basic premise senses first.

2. Actually Read All Terms, Conditions and Disclosures Presented Closely

Take time actually reading often densely packed fine print passages frequently exposing unreasonable contradictory monthly charges exceeding $100 despite reasonable initial advertised expectations around free merchandise or one-time shipping costs of only $10 instead. Never expect full default transparency with control neutrality from marketers regarding crucial financial and privacy related details.

3. Consider Both Individual and Collective Warning Sign Red Flags Holistically

No single suspicious isolated signal alone confirms underlying fraud risks definitively by itself. However, collectively step back assessing inconsistencies around urgency levels, domain name choices, comment irregularities and disclosure contradictions revealing bigger picture perspectives on probabilistic scam likelihood rightfully informing much wiser self-preservation choices against potential data threats.

4. Report All Predatory Fraud Attempts Targeting Consumers By Deception

Even if personal financial injury incurred seems limited initially, reporting suspected appliance scams through properly documenting website links, fake celebrity imagery and truth-violating trust concerns at scale helps all consumer classes avoid repeated mass predatory targeting over long horizons as authorities build investor protection and consumer safety fraud cases against orchestrators forcing increased transparency compliance through policy changes ultimately benefiting the public rather than special interests alone. But this requires mass reporting scale event reaching thresholds forcing action through measuring threat levels by patterns documented.

In conclusion, today’s technologies enable even amateur scammers easily imitating respected celebrity figures through social channels precisely intending exploitation of psychological vulnerabilities rather than demonstrating genuine corporate contest goodwill assumed automatically by followers not questioning closely enough reasonable legitimacy first. But individuals maintain power securing assets by proactively maintaining heightened skepticism and insisting external unbiased verification prior acting during experiences wrapped too perfectly balanced regarding projected risk-reward ratios. Don’t become the next preventable data breach victim simply hoping stroke good fortune fall one’s lap without vetting or compromising own stability reacting impulsively questionable “no-brainer” extraordinary freebie offers tied closely incredible true stories conveniently requiring temporarily access finances first. It simply proves too risky long run.. Posted: Dec 29, 2023 1:25 PMUpdated: Dec 29, 2023 1:25 PM

Ree Drummond is taking to social media warning her fans about an AI generated faked video of her doing a cookware giveaway. In the video, Drummond is doing a giveaway for Le Creuset cookware, but Drummond says the video is fake and that artificial intelligence generated her voice to make the ad.

Experts say this is unethical in an attempt to sell something and that scammers can use such videos to collect personal information from the public.

In the modern digital landscape, it’s more vital than ever to be an informed consumer and identify frauds like this attempting to capitalize on fake celebrity endorsements. Keep reading to learn the tactics scammers use and make sure you don’t fall for this malicious scam.

Overview of the Celebrity Le Creuset Giveaway Scam

The celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam operates by promoting fake promotions on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and other social platforms using deepfake videos and sponsored posts. The ads feature realistic-looking videos of various celebrities announcing they have excess Le Creuset inventory so they’re giving it away for free to fans.

Some of the stars being impersonated include:

Lainey Wilson

Ree Drummond

Taylor Swift

Oprah

Jennifer Lopez

Trisha Yearwood

Martha Stewart

The deepfake videos are created using advanced artificial intelligence to closely match everything from the celebrity’s voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns. This lends credibility so users believe the stars are genuinely endorsing a free Le Creuset giveaway.

When social media users click on these ads, they’re taken to elaborate fake news websites made to look like MSN, Buzzfeed, People Magazine, and more. The fake articles promise users can receive expensive Le Creuset cookware or bakeware sets completely free, with just a small $10 shipping fee.

In reality, this is a front to obtain credit card information and unknowingly register people for an expensive monthly subscription they didn’t agree to. The scammers bank on the legitimacy of celebrity names and urgency of limited-time offers to trick victims into handing over their money and personal data.

Breakdown of the Scam Process

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam operates at each stage:

Scammers create fake social media ads using deepfake videos of celebrities urgently announcing free Le Creuset giveaways. The AI-generated videos appear very real and convincing.

When users click on these sponsored posts, they are sent to elaborate fake news articles promising free Le Creuset products for a small shipping fee of around $10.

Excited users provide their personal and payment information to claim their “free” cookware set and cover shipping costs.

But users are actually subscribing to a recurring monthly fee they aren’t made aware of. Initial charges of $89+ hit their cards within days.

The monthly fraudulent charges continue indefinitely until users spot the activity and cancel. Victims never receive any free products.

Bogus “customer service” contacts pretend charges were agreed to, refuse refunds, and use other shady tactics.

As you can see, this scam relies entirely on fabricating celebrity affiliations, disguising monthly fees, and pressuring users to act fast before the invented limited-time promotion expires.

Detailed Breakdown of the Scam Process

To fully understand how this widespread scam works and identify red flags, here is a more in-depth walkthrough of the step-by-step process:

Step 1 – Fake Social Media Ads

The scam begins with promoted ads run on social platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. The ads include video clips apparently showing various celebrities casually speaking directly to the camera/audience.

Thanks to advancements in deepfake technology, the videos appear incredibly realistic. The celebrity’s face, voice, mannerisms, and speech patterns are cloned almost flawlessly by the AI software. Absolutely nothing visually or audibly signals the videos are counterfeit.

In the forged videos, the celebrity explains they’re urgently giving away free Le Creuset products because of excess inventory they need to get rid of. Specific details include:

A limited-edition product collaboration with Le Creuset resulted in “thousands of excess sets” sitting in warehouses.

Rather than letting the expensive cookware go to waste, they’ve decided to generously give sets away to loyal fans who act fast.

Sets are available on a first come, first served basis until the leftover stock sells out.

Urgency and exclusivity tactics like this encourage social media users to immediately click through and claim the purported free products.

Step 2 – Fake News Websites

When people click on the promo ads, they are redirected to pseudo news articles that appear at first glance to be from legitimate publications like People Magazine, Buzzfeed, and major news networks. However, the sites are complete fakes.

While cleverly designed, closer inspection reveals multiple red flags, including:

Incorrect website URLs (ex. “Peopel.com” vs People.com).

Amateur site formatting, logos, fonts, and stock imagery.

Missing contact pages, sloppy text, broken navigation links.

No links or mentions of any real writer/journalist at the site.

No actual social media profiles associated with the fraudulent domain.

The goal is tricking users into trusting the false information and celebrity endorsements being presented in the articles.

These fake news stories provide additional background on the supposed excess Le Creuset inventory prompting the urgent giveaways. They include convincing quotes from the celebrities expressing excitement for fans to score free cookware thanks to the special product collaboration. Of course, all quotes are invented for the scam.

The articles emphasize readers must act fast to claim their free sets before the limited supply is gone. A sense of urgency pushes victims to provide their information without deeper scrutiny that would reveal the scam.

Near the bottom of the page, a prominent “Claim Yours Now!” button is presented along with text stating readers can obtain their free Le Creuset items with just a small $9.95 shipping and processing fee. In reality, this modest charge is a front for illegitimate recurring subscriptions being applied to user accounts without consent.

Step 3 – Submit Personal and Payment Information

When users click the “Claim Yours Now!” CTA buttons eager to score expensive free Le Creuset products, they are redirected to an online order form on a third-party website unaffiliated with any of the celebrities or brands involved.

These fake promotion sites have vague names like “OnlineProductOffers”, “LimitedTimeGiveaways” or “DealsZone”. They continue the ruse by using Le Creuset branding and imagery along with urgent messaging about limited supply.

To finalize the order for their “free” items, users must fill out personal details including:

Full Name

Physical Address

Email Address

Phone Number

They then must enter credit/debit card payment information so the $9.95 shipping costs can be processed to deliver the free products.

An additional checkbox has users “agree” that they understand the single $9.95 charge to cover shipping and handling. Nowhere on the page is it revealed this activates an ongoing monthly subscription. That critical detail is buried deep in lengthy terms and conditions, knowing most people won’t read the fine print.

As soon as users submit their info, their payment method is automatically enrolled in expensive recurring subscription charges without any further consent.

Step 4 – Monthly Subscription Charges Begin

Within 3-5 days of providing payment details, victims will experience the first fraudulent subscription withdrawal from their account for amounts like $89.95 or $99.95. These excessive fees are wholly unrelated to any supposed shipping charge.

The shady websites apply monthly subscriptions using the collected user data and payment methods. The excessive monthly charges will continue indefinitely until identified and cancelled. Of course, users never receive any free Le Creuset products as promised initially.

Step 5 – Fake Customer Service if You Complain

When defrauded users eventually notice the unauthorized activity on their accounts and contact customer service to complain, they experience more deception and stonewalling. The fraudsters operating the sites insist the monthly fees were clearly agreed to in initial fine print terms.

Their tactics include:

Citing unrelated terms & conditions users “signed” as consent to recurring billing.

Claiming the monthly fee is for unused free trial offers on other sites in a network users accessed.

Placing victims on endless holds then disconnecting the call to avoid issuing refunds.

Outright refusing refunds and threatening legal action or penalties for “violating” terms.

In the end, almost no users are able to recover lost funds or cancel these celebrity giveaway scams once their payment information has been compromised. The entire system is constructed to mislead at every stage.

Recognizing Red Flags of the Scam

Now that you understand the step-by-step workings of the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam, here are key signs to recognize as potential red flags when encountering questionable offers online:

Too good to be true – Free luxury products and massive discounts are always a red flag signaling a potential scam attempt. Real prizes or freebies are never brand new expensive merchandise like Le Creuset cookware.

– Free luxury products and massive discounts are always a red flag signaling a potential scam attempt. Real prizes or freebies are never brand new expensive merchandise like Le Creuset cookware. Aggressive sales tactics – Pressuring language about “limited sets” or “act fast before it’s gone!” should be viewed cautiously. Scammers create false urgency to get users to hand over payment info and bypass scrutiny.

– Pressuring language about “limited sets” or “act fast before it’s gone!” should be viewed cautiously. Scammers create false urgency to get users to hand over payment info and bypass scrutiny.

– Why would a free cookware offer need your SSN or bank login credentials? Only scammers ask for more personal info than reasonably needed. Hidden terms and conditions – If an offer is free and being endorsed publicly, terms governing charges will be stated clearly. Scams bury dubious recurring fees deep in fine print intentionally.

Stay skeptical whenever you see urgent limited-time promotions, celebrity endorsements imploring you to act fast on social media, and legal jargon downplaying otherwise hidden costs. If an offer arouses suspicion, trust your judgement and avoid providing personal or payment details until legitimacy can be confirmed.

How to Spot the Scam on Facebook on Social Media

How to Spot the Scam on Facebook

The celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam is promoted heavily on Facebook. Here’s what to watch for:

Video ads in feeds using deepfakes of celebrities announcing the urgent giveaways. The AI-faked videos will closely match their look, voice and mannerisms.

Posts urging users to claim the exclusive free offer before leftover inventory is gone. Scams use false scarcity.

Comments with generic excitement about the promotion to build legitimacy. These are usually bots and fake accounts.

Wrong domain names (ex. Facbook instead of Facebook) in page URLs pointing to fake news sites.

Links to sketchy websites unaffiliated with the celebrity or Le Creuset in any way.

If you see these signs, report the content immediately. Do not engage or click on links as it could compromise your personal information with scammers.

How to Spot the Scam on Instagram

Here are red flags the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam is promoted on Instagram:

Targeted sponsored posts in your feeds using deepfake celebrity videos announcing the promotion.

Captions emphasizing a limited-time offer and urgency to act fast. Scammers create false urgency.

Comments from fake bot accounts expressing excitement. Real users won’t engage much with scam posts.

Accounts pretending affiliation with celebrities by using their images, but having unrelated usernames.

Bio links pointing to fake landing pages/websites unassociated with the celebrity or brand.

Avoid sponsored celebrity giveaway promotions on Instagram. Report them as scam attempts to get the content removed ASAP.

How to Spot the Scam on TikTok

What to Do if You Fell Victim to the Scam

If you entered any sensitive information or payment details in relation to a free celebrity Le Creuset promotion, here are the steps to take right away in attempting to address the situation:

Step 1: Contact Your Bank

Call your credit card company or bank immediately to report being scammed into an unwanted recurring subscription. Ask them to block any future associated charges. See if any fraudulent fees can be reversed or refunded depending on how long ago entered. Acting quickly is key for the best outcome. Provide transaction dates and merchant details.

Step 2: Cancel Any Accounts Created

If you created accounts on related scam websites, login and permanently delete or deactivate them. This removes stored payment data from their records, preventing continued billing. Also unsubscribe from any emails you may have signed up for in the process by clicking “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” links at the bottom.

Step 3: Change Exposed Passwords

Change any passwords you used on the fake promotion sites ASAP if they’re used elsewhere. Scammers can exploit password reuse to access more of your accounts. Enable two-factor authentication for additional security on sensitive logins.

Step 4: Watch for Other Suspicious Charges

Carefully monitor bank statements, credit reports, and all connected accounts over the next few months for any other unusual or unauthorized charges. Since scammers trade stolen information online, one scam can lead to more fraud down the line. Report any dubious activities immediately.

Overview of the Blake Shelton Le Creuset Giveaway Scam

The Blake Shelton Le Creuset giveaway scam is being heavily promoted across social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube using targeted sponsored ads and posts. These ads leverage realistic-looking deepfake AI video footage of Blake Shelton announcing an urgent giveaway of free Le Creuset cookware sets to his loyal fans.

The convincing deepfake videos show Blake stating that due to a warehouse packing mistake, he has thousands of surplus Le Creuset sets to offload, so he’s giving them away for free to supporters if they act fast. The high-quality AI replication of Blake’s face, voice, and speech patterns make the videos appear very authentic and lure social media users into believing the country music star is genuinely endorsing a free cookware giveaway.

When users click on these enticing social media ads for the free Le Creuset set giveaway, they are redirected to elaborate fake news articles hosted on fraudulent domains posing as trusted mainstream news sites like Fox News, CNN, NBC, and even niche sites like Food Network Magazine.

The deception continues on these fake news sites featuring stolen logos and branding from legitimate networks. The articles reinforce the charade with claims that the giveaway is 100% real and made possible because Blake Shelton wants to urgently award free Le Creuset cookware sets to fans rather than letting excess inventory go to waste.

The fake news articles attribute convincing quotes to Blake expressing excitement for fans to score expensive Le Creuset sets thanks to the special exclusivity of the warehouse surplus promotion. Of course, all statements are completely fabricated for the sake of the scam.

Near the bottom of the page, the fake articles emphasize interested readers can claim their free Le Creuset cookware set by paying just a small $9.95 or $9.96 shipping and processing fee to cover transportation costs. This is where the scam truly begins.

Users who click the prominent “Claim My Offer” or “Claim Free Cookware Set” buttons featured throughout the fake articles are sent to shady third-party websites to enter payment and personal information. These external sites have no affiliation with Blake Shelton or Le Creuset whatsoever.

Their domains often have vague names like “OnlineProductPromotions”, “LimitedTimeOffers”, or “FreebieWeekly” to continue tricking users that they are part of the legitimate giveaway offer. Stock photos of Le Creuset cookware are used alongside urgent messaging about limited supply remaining.

At this point, victims of the scam must provide sensitive personal and financial information including full name, physical address, email address, phone number, and credit card details. The form reiterates that this is solely to cover the $9.95 shipping and processing costs.

An additional checkbox even states “I understand the ONE TIME shipping fee of $9.95 to receive my free product.” In reality, this payment data is used to enroll users in an expensive monthly subscription they are completely unaware of.

Once victims input their information and submit the $9.95 payment, their credit card is automatically signed up for recurring subscription fees of around $89.95 that will continue indefinitely every month. But the monthly charges are intentionally omitted and disguised by the scam until after users provide their data.

Within 3-5 days of victims submitting their information and making the “shipping” payment, the first $89.95 subscription fee is withdrawn from their account. This is wholly unrelated to the $9.95 upfront cost users paid under the impression it was just for package handling.

The shady third-party websites operate this subscription grift using the credit card details entered by victims when signing up for the purported free cookware deal. The excessive unauthorized monthly $89.95 charges continue being taken from victims’ accounts monthly until they eventually notice what’s happening.

Of course, victims of the scam never end up receiving any free Le Creuset products, cookbooks, or anything else they were promised. The entire premise of the warehouse surplus giveaway is fake and no such association exists between Blake Shelton and the brand.

The solely purpose is deceiving social media users into relinquishing their personal and financial information under false pretenses, and leveraging that data to unknowingly register them for costly monthly subscriptions without consent.

The elaborate scam is able to convince unsuspecting social media users by employing a range of deceptive tactics, including:

Highly realistic deepfake AI video and audio of Blake Shelton announcing the fake giveaway promotion, which tricks users into believing it’s endorsed by him.

Fake advertisements and sponsored posts promoting the giveaway that are made to look like legitimate social media marketing.

Fake news websites impersonating real mainstream news networks with matching branding, logos, and graphics.

Articles populated with fake quotes attributed to Blake expressing excitement around fans receiving free products.

Prominent calls-to-action inviting readers to claim their free set for just a small $9.95 shipping payment.

External domains posing as part of the promotion to harvest user personal and financial data.

Fine print and checkboxes concealing that users are actually being registered for costly monthly subscriptions when submitting payment info rather than a one-time shipping fee.

Omission of any mention regarding monthly recurring charges, terms & conditions, or notification of users’ credit cards being used for ongoing billing.

Lack of any way to cancel, manage, or stop the unwanted subscription charges being applied due to the third-party nature of the shady websites.

Without proper scrutiny, the multiple moving parts of this scam combine seamlessly to deceive users through every stage as they get lured in by the perceived celebrity endorsement, urgency surrounding limited free products, and appeal of only needing to cover a small shipping payment.

In actuality, Blake Shelton has no knowledge of or participation in any such giveaway promotion. His likeness is being used entirely without consent through deepfake AI technology as part of the elaborate ruse.

Sadly, this scam preys on the trusting nature of Blake Shelton fans and social media users excited by the prospect of scoring expensive Le Creuset cookware totally free. But in reality, victims are signing themselves up to be unwittingly billed monthly subscription fees through by providing their personal and payment data under false pretenses.

The sophisticated scam is able to maintain the charade using the following unethical tactics:

Refusal to provide any working way to cancel, modify, or stop the unauthorized recurring charges from being applied.

Deceptive cancellation and customer service contacts that offer no actual way to halt the subscription billing.

Claiming the monthly fees were always part of agreed upon terms and conditions, banking on most people not reading the dense fine print before signing up.

Citing that the monthly billing is for additional free trial offers, products, or services users had access to after providing their information.

Insisting users violated terms by disputing the fees and threatening punitive legal action or penalties for going against the “agreement”.

Placing crying victims on endless hold times before disconnecting the call to avoid addressing the fraudulent charges.

Outright refusal to issue any refunds or reimbursement for the unauthorized subscription fees deducted on a monthly basis from victims’ accounts.

So in summary, this scam leverages social media ads featuring deepfake videos of Blake Shelton, fake news articles, and urgent limited-time promotion tactics to convince users to provide their personal and financial information under the false belief they will receive free Le Creuset cookware. In reality, they are being signed up for costly monthly subscription plans without consent, operated by shady third-party websites.

These sites continue charging victims’ credit cards exorbitant recurring fees while stonewalling any attempt to cancel the unwanted subscriptions or attain refunds. The scam relies on exploiting the goodwill and fandom of Blake Shelton to lure innocent users into relinquishing sensitive data that allows scammers to unlawfully extract money on an ongoing basis.

Detailed Breakdown of the Scam Process

To fully understand this pervasive scam and identify red flags, here is a more in-depth walkthrough of how it works at each step:

Step 1 – Fake Social Media Ads

The scam starts with sponsored video ads run on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and more. The videos appear to show Blake Shelton casually speaking directly to the camera/viewers.

Thanks to deepfake AI technology, the videos match Blake’s face, voice, speech patterns, and mannerisms almost flawlessly. There are no visible or audible signs exposing them as fake.

In the forged videos, Blake states he partnered with Le Creuset on a special product line that resulted in “thousands of surplus sets” sitting in warehouses. So before the excess inventory goes to waste, he’s offering it to fans for free on a first come, first served basis.

The faked urgency and exclusivity aim to pressure viewers into immediately clicking through to claim their “free” cookware.

Step 2 – Fake News Websites

When users click on the promo ads, they are redirected to fake news articles made to appear as if published on real sites like Buzzfeed, MSN, People Magazine, etc. But the lookalike sites are complete scams.

While designed to look convincing initially, some red flags include:

Wrong web URLs (ex. Pe0ple.com vs People.com)

Poor grammar, formatting, low-quality writing, and images.

Missing contact pages, broken links, limited menus and navigation options.

No legitimate journalist names, social media profiles, or sources linked.

Still, the sites trick hurried users into believing the false Blake Shelton endorsement and giveaway promotion.

The fictitious articles provide background on the supposed Blake Shelton x Le Creuset collaboration prompting the urgent giveaway. They attribute convincing quotes to Blake expressing excitement for fans to receive pricey cookware thanks to the surplus inventory loophole.

The articles warn readers to hurry and claim sets before the limited supply is gone. This sense of urgency aims to get users to hand over payment details without deeper scrutiny.

Near the end, readers are prompted to click “Claim Yours Now!” and cover just a small $10 shipping and handling fee to receive their free Le Creuset items. In reality, this initiates unwanted recurring subscription fees.

Step 3 – Submit Personal and Payment Information

When users click the “Claim Yours Now!” buttons eager to score expensive free Le Creuset sets, they are redirected to an order form on a shady third-party website unaffiliated with Blake Shelton or Le Creuset.

These sites have vague names like “OnlineProductPromos”, “LimitedTimeOffersZone” or “SuperGiveawaysHub”. They continue the ruse by featuring Le Creuset logos and urgency messaging about limited sets remaining.

To finalize their “free” order, users must provide personal details including:

Full Name

Physical Address

Email Address

Phone Number

They then must enter credit/debit card information so the $10 shipping costs can be processed for delivery of the free items.

Nowhere on the page does it reveal this activates recurring subscription charges. That critical detail is purposefully omitted until after users submit their information.

Step 4 – Monthly Subscription Charges Begin

Within 3-5 days of providing payment info, victims will experience the first unauthorized subscription withdrawal from their account for excessive amounts like $89.95 or $99.95.

These overpriced monthly fees continue indefinitely until identified and cancelled by users. Of course, victims never receive any free Le Creuset products as originally promised.

Step 5 – Fake Customer Service if You Complain

When users eventually notice the fraudulent charges and contact customer service to complain, they experience pushback and deception. The fraudsters insist monthly fees were clearly agreed to in fine print terms.

Their shady tactics include:

Claiming the monthly fee is for unused free trial offers on other sites in a network users joined.

Outright refusing refunds and threatening legal action for “violating” terms and conditions.

Placing angry victims on endless holds before disconnecting the call to avoid dealing with them.

Almost no users can get money back once scammed by one of these celebrity endorsement giveaways. The systems are designed to prevent refunds at every stage.

Recognizing Red Flags of the Scam

Now that you understand the step-by-step workings of the Blake Shelton Le Creuset giveaway scam, here are key red flags to recognize as potential signs of a scam:
