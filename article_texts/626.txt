Bad actors are using the Le Creuset giveaway scam to trick people into giving their credit card information. How do they do that? Of course, by using celebrity identities to trick people into believing that the Le Creuset giveaway scam is legit. However, it is not.

Have you heard about the latest scam sweeping the internet? It’s all about a fake giveaway of Le Creuset cookware, and guess what? It’s got Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez’s names all over it! But, before you get too excited, let us tell you, it’s a big, fat scam. Yep, you heard it right. These clever tricksters have been using AI to make videos that look and sound just like our beloved celebs. They’re saying things like, “I’m so excited to give away free Le Creuset sets!” But here’s the catch: it’s all a lie.

Don’t fall for the Le Creuset giveaway scam

These videos popped up all over Meta (the folks behind Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok. And they look so real! But, the real kicker? They’re not just using Taylor and Selena’s faces. They’re deepfaking them. That’s a fancy way of saying they’re using high-tech AI to copy their voices, facial expressions, and even the way they talk. And boy, does it look convincing.

Now, these sneaky ads have links that take you to websites that seem totally legit. They look like they’re from the Food Network or other big names in the news world. They lure you in with promises of “free” Le Creuset goodies for just a tiny shipping fee of $9.96. But here’s where it gets nasty. People who tried to get their free set ended up with no cookware. Instead, they got slapped with an $89.95 monthly subscription on top of that “shipping” fee.

Swifties, Selenators, and more celebrity fans are the targets

The main victims of this scam? Fans of celebrities. These fake ads are all over social media, targeting fans of Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and others, says Engadget. They show videos of these stars saying they’re giving away Le Creuset products for free. But remember, it’s all a setup.

The list of impersonated stars includes:

Is the Le Creuset giveaway legit

No, the Le Creuset giveaway is not legit. Bad actors from some parts of the world are using AI-generated deepfake videos of your favorite singer and actors to trick you into giving them your credit card information. Please be cautious against these kinds of scam attempts, as they are certainly not legit.

What is deepfake?

Deepfakes are a big deal in the tech world. They use high-end AI to create videos or audio that mimic real people. It’s like digital copying but very advanced. The AI studies how someone talks and moves then make a video where it looks like that person is doing something they never really did. It’s hard to tell them apart from real videos; they’re becoming more common.

Deepfakes, like this cookware giveaway, can be used for harmless jokes or serious scams. As the technology improves, it’s getting tougher to spot the fakes.

What to do against deepfake scams?

So, what can you do to stay safe from these scams? First, be wary of offers that seem unreal. If a famous person is apparently giving away expensive items for nothing, it’s likely a scam. Do some checking. Look at the celebrity’s or brand’s real social media. If there’s a genuine giveaway, they’ll talk about it there. Also, be careful with websites that look strange or have odd web addresses.

Your personal information is valuable. Don’t share your credit card details or personal info unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe. And if you see a deepfake or scam, report it. This helps platforms like Facebook and TikTok fight these scams, but they need us to help find them.

In summary, stay alert and skeptical. Don’t let things like the Le Creuset giveaway scam fool you. You can protect yourself from these clever but deceptive tricks by being cautious and informed!

Taylor Swift’s affinity for Le Creuset is real: Her collection of the cookware has been featured on a Tumblr account dedicated to the pop star’s home décor, showcased in her gift choices at a fan’s bridal shower and shown in a Netflix documentary that was highlighted by Le Creuset’s Facebook page.

What is not real: Ms. Swift’s endorsement of the company’s products, which have appeared in recent weeks in ads on Facebook and elsewhere featuring her face and voice.

The ads are among the many celebrity-focused scams made far more convincing by artificial intelligence. Within a single week in October, the actor Tom Hanks, the journalist Gayle King and the YouTube personality MrBeast all said that A.I. versions of themselves had been used, without permission, for deceptive dental plan promotions, iPhone giveaway offers and other ads.

In Ms. Swift’s case, experts said, artificial intelligence technology helped create a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, which was cobbled together with footage of her alongside clips showing Le Creuset Dutch ovens. In several ads, Ms. Swift’s cloned voice addressed “Swifties” — her fans — and said she was “thrilled” to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.
