These scammers are gonna be on the receiving end of some bad “Karma.”

Several die-hard Taylor Swift fans have been reportedly scammed out of hundreds of dollars after tricksters released advertisements employing AI-generated video of the Grammy winner peddling Le Creuset in an attempt to steal money and data from fans.

The ads — which can be found across all social media platforms — show Swift, 34, standing next to the Le Creuset Dutch oven, which, according to the official website, runs anywhere from $180 to $750 depending on the size and style.

According to a report by the New York Times, the fake Swift tells fans that she is “thrilled” to be giving away free sets of the expensive cookware, but only if they click on a link and answer a few questions.

The report reveals that several participants were sent to what seemed like legitimate websites populated with several fake reviews and coverage.

The website then asks hopeful buyers to fork over a “small shipping fee of $9.96.” Buyers are then unknowingly hit with recurring charges without ever actually receiving the pot.

“These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” computer science professor Siwei Lyu told the Times of the computer-rendered Swift video. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.”

According to Lyu, the ad copy was likely derived from a text-to-speech platform.

Swift is the latest of several celebrities to be impersonated by AI.

Last month, the voice-cloning startup Respeecher managed to re-create the voice of Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart by employing a voice actor to mimic the late actor’s style of speech.

The voice of Stewart, who gained notoriety for films such as “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Rear Window,” appears on the app in a premium story called “It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story,” billed as a “heartwarming new holiday tale” on the Calm app.

The Post also previously reported that Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks have fallen victim to AI voice-cloning without their permission.

Johansson officially took legal action in November after an artificial intelligence app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar used the actress’ face and voice in an advertisement.

“We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have,” the “Avengers” star’s’ attorney told Variety at the time.

Hanks took to his Instagram in October to warn fans that he was not peddling a dental plan when a video using his likeness emerged.

“Beware!!” Hanks, 67, wrote beneath a photo of his lookalike. “There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me.”

“I have nothing to do with it,” the “Forrest Gump” star added.. Deepfakes, technology to face-swap images, have ushered in a new era of scams. In the past year, fake video of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Mr. Beast have been used to shill products they don't actually endorse. The latest of these scams is a phony giveaway of cookware Le Creuset by deepfaked Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, the New York Times and others report.

In these AI-generated videos that ran on Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok, Swift's appearance and voice were imitated to express that she's "thrilled" to give away free Le Creuset sets. There are also fake ads of Selena Gomez, according to cybersecurity site MalwareTips, where a deepfaked Gomez promises free cookware due to a warehouse error.

These ads included links to websites appearing to be the Food Network and other legitimate news outlets, saying that the "free" Le Creuset items required a one-time "small shipping fee of $9.96." Users that attempted to claim the free set and entered their personal information didn't receive any Le Creuset, but instead were signed up to a monthly $89.95 subscription in addition to that "shipping" fee of $9.96, MalwareTips states.

A Meta spokesperson told the Times that these fraudulent ads violate its policies, but are often missed by its review systems because creators cloak their content. Meta has taken legal action against some perpetrators of these scam ads. A TikTok spokesperson told the Times that creators are required to disclose whether media is synthetic or manipulated, and that advertisers must obtain consent for "any synthetic media which contains a public figure."

AI fools us — and will continue to as the technology advances. Here's a rule of thumb: If an ad featuring a celebrity isn't on that celebrity's or the company's social media accounts, it's likely fake.. Le Creuset said it’s not affiliated with the artificial intelligence-generated Taylor Swift ad that has popped up online appearing to promote a cookware set.

The ad, which began circulating on social media earlier this month, used Swift’s likeness by deepfaking her voice and layering it over camera shots of Le Creuset cookware spliced with clips of her speaking.

“Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the voice says in a robotic tone. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

It appears to have originally been posted by a Facebook page titled “The most profitable shares," and as of Wednesday morning it had amassed about 2,300 views. A spokesperson for Meta told NBC News that the ad has been removed.

A spokesperson for Swift did not respond to a request for comment.

In a statement, the cookware company said it has nothing to do with the fake ad.

“Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” Le Creuset said. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.”

The ad is the latest in a string of AI-generated posts attempting to fake a celebrity's or influencer's endorsement of a product.

In November, Scarlett Johansson’s legal team demanded the app Lisa AI, which generates stylized avatars based on real photos of people, to stop using an AI-generated version of her in an online ad.

YouTube star MrBeast has also called out a viral deepfake video using his face and voice to advertise an purported iPhone 15 giveaway — just days after Tom Hanks posted his own statement on Instagram to clarify that he had “nothing to do with” a video using his AI-generated likeness to promote a dental plan.

Although deepfake technology has been around for years, rapid advancements in generative AI over the past year — along with its growing mainstream use — have sparked renewed concern over the ease of replicating people’s likenesses without consent.

In August, NBC News viewed more than 50 videos posted to platforms like Facebook, TikTok and YouTube that used digitally manipulated images and audio of public figures. All of those videos seemingly aimed to scam viewers of their money.

The increasing accessibility of this technology has even led experts to speculate on the possibility of a “deepfake election” cycle this year, with political disinformation through AI-manipulated videos likely to run rampant. Others also worry about a growing market for deepfake porn, which thrives off producing fake videos featuring the likenesses of real people without their consent.. Taylor Swift’s affinity for Le Creuset is real: Her collection of the cookware has been featured on a Tumblr account dedicated to the pop star’s home décor, showcased in her gift choices at a fan’s bridal shower and shown in a Netflix documentary that was highlighted by Le Creuset’s Facebook page.

What is not real: Ms. Swift’s endorsement of the company’s products, which have appeared in recent weeks in ads on Facebook and elsewhere featuring her face and voice.

The ads are among the many celebrity-focused scams made far more convincing by artificial intelligence. Within a single week in October, the actor Tom Hanks, the journalist Gayle King and the YouTube personality MrBeast all said that A.I. versions of themselves had been used, without permission, for deceptive dental plan promotions, iPhone giveaway offers and other ads.

In Ms. Swift’s case, experts said, artificial intelligence technology helped create a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, which was cobbled together with footage of her alongside clips showing Le Creuset Dutch ovens. In several ads, Ms. Swift’s cloned voice addressed “Swifties” — her fans — and said she was “thrilled” to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.
