Facebook's "Year in Review" feature is a delight to some and a painful reminder for others of events in 2014 they'd rather not be reminded of as the year comes to a close.

Web designer Eric Meyer's daughter Rebecca died in 2014. Last week, Meyer wrote of his anguish at seeing her photo as the featured image in the Year in Review cooked up by Facebook's algorithms and delivered to him on Christmas Eve.

"I didn't go looking for grief this afternoon, but it found me anyway," Meyer wrote on his blog. "[A]nd I have designers and programmers to thank for it. In this case, the designers and programmers are somewhere at Facebook."

At least the social network has had the decency to apologize for its tone deafness. As spotted by The Guardian, Meyer said he'd received a personal apology from Jonathan Gheller, Facebook's product manager for Year in Review.

Gheller contacted him "before the story started hitting the papers, and he was sincerely apologetic," Meyer wrote in a follow-up post. The Facebook rep also told Meyer he was "determined to do better in the future."

"[The app] was awesome for a lot of people, but clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy," Gheller told The Washington Post.

That's a nice sentiment, but there's still the problem of trusting an algorithm to filter through a person's social media content to determine what truly sums them up. Facebook users are complex individualsthe ones that aren't bots or corporate landing pages, anyway.

One Facebook friend of my own had a tuna sandwich as the lead image for his Year in Review, while The Guardian pointed to another user whose burning apartment was apparently the bit of warm-and-fuzzy imagery the app decided to serve up for the holidays.

On the other hand, Meyer himself was very charitable about the intent behind Year in Reviewand also upset that some of his supporters have hurled invective at Facebook and the team that built the app.

"This inadvertent algorithmic cruelty is the result of code that works in the overwhelming majority of cases, reminding people of the awesomeness of their years, showing them selfies at a party or whale spouts from sailing boats or the marina outside their vacation house," the web designer said.

"But for those of us who lived through the death of loved ones, or spent extended time in the hospital, or were hit by divorce or losing a job or any one of a hundred crises, we might not want another look at this past year."

Meyer also said that it was a mistake to think the Year in Review app was unusual in handling certain scenarios very poorly.

"Yes, their design failed to handle situations like mine, but in that, they're hardly alone. This happens all the time, all over the web, in every imaginable context. Taking worst-case scenarios into account is something that web design does poorly, and usually not at all," he said.. Facebook has apologised after learning, yet again, that not everything can be done algorithmically. Some things, it seems, need the human touch.

The company’s latest blunder stems from a seemingly innocuous feature it rolls out to its users shortly before Christmas every year, called the Year in Review.

It lets users automatically select photos, wall posts and other content from a user’s past year, offering those which gained the most responses in likes or comments as “highlights”. Facebook users can then piece together a scrapbook of the past year, and experience instant nostalgia.

This year, to go one step further, Facebook automatically picked one particularly well-engaged photo to present to users, under the banner: “Here’s what your year looked like!” For many users, that will have been a happy memory, such as a graduation, wedding, or the birth of a child.

But for some users, the algorithm forced painful memories back to the surface.

Web designer Eric Meyer wrote on his blog that Facebook had shown him a picture of his daughter, Rebecca, who died in 2014.

“Yes, my year looked like that. True enough. My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl. It was still unkind to remind me so forcefully,” he wrote in a post titled “Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty”.

“And I know, of course, that this is not a deliberate assault. This inadvertent algorithmic cruelty is the result of code that works in the overwhelming majority of cases, reminding people of the awesomeness of their years, showing them selfies at a party or whale spouts from sailing boats or the marina outside their vacation house.”

In a follow-up post, Meyer said the product manager for Year in Review, Jonathan Gheller, had personally apologised to him for the blunder. The Washington Post said Gheller described the app as “awesome for a lot of people, but clearly in this case we brought him [Meyer] grief rather than joy … We can do better — I’m very grateful he took the time in his grief to write the blog post.”

The feature has already been tweaked following feedback: it initially ended the slideshow with the words “It’s been a great year! Thanks for being a part of it.” It now uses the more neutral language “See you next year!”

Writer Julieanne Smolinski shared another story: her ex-boyfriend’s year in review, which framed a picture of his house on fire.

And many other users had similar experiences:

I'm so glad that Facebook made my 'Year in Review' image a picture of my now dead dog. I totally wanted to sob uncontrollably this Xmas Eve. — Sarah-Jane (@isloveSJ) December 24, 2014

This is the photo Facebook picked out—my dead father's ashes—just to confirm my previous "year in review" tweet. pic.twitter.com/7wmx7SCUUz — Mark Duffy (@copyranter) December 24, 2014

Facebook "year in review" thing is kind of awful as it chose 2 pictures of my dogs that died this year & uses poor graphic design elements. — Travis Louie (@travislouie) December 27, 2014

Won't be sharing my Facebook Year in Review, which "highlights" a post on a friend's death in May despite words like "killed" and "sad day" — Andrew Katz (@katz) December 29, 2014

As for Meyer, he suggests two things Facebook, and firms like it, can do to avoid this sort of inadvertent cruelty. “First, don’t pre-fill a picture until you’re sure the user actually wants to see pictures from their year. And second, instead of pushing the app at people, maybe ask them if they’d like to try a preview—just a simple yes or no. If they say no, ask if they want to be asked again later, or never again. And then, of course, honour their choices.

“It may not be possible to reliably pre-detect whether a person wants to see their year in review, but it’s not at all hard to ask politely—empathetically—if it’s something they want. That’s an easily-solvable problem. Had the app been designed with worst-case scenarios in mind, it probably would have been.”
