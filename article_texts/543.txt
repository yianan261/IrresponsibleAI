A deepfake of an explosion at the Pentagon that caused the stock market to dip exemplified the misinformation risks of generative AI.

On Monday, a seemingly AI-generated image of what looked like an explosion outside of the Pentagon circulated on Twitter. The Arlington Police Department quickly debunked the image tweeting, "There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public."

But not before the stock market dipped by 0.26 percent before bouncing back, according to Insider.

It's unclear how the image was created, but it has the telltale signs of an AI-generated image. The fencing in front of the building is blurred and the columns appear to be different widths. Any social media sleuth accustomed to spotting photoshopped images of celebrities and influencers would have noticed this, but as generative AI continues to improve, deepfakes will be harder to spot.

Even with Arlington PD's quick response, Twitter's mess of a verification system compounded the issue. One of the accounts that tweeted the image was a verified account impersonating a Bloomberg news feed. That account, called @BloombergFeed, has since been suspended.

Other accounts that tweeted the image were @DeItaone and the account Russian state-media owned site RT. Now that anyone can pay to become verified on Twitter, situations like this are the perfect storm of misinformation.

A fake Twitter account shares a fake image that leads to real consequences. Welcome to 2023.. . When you report on the cut and thrust of breakneck developments, big money deals, mind-bending hype, and multi-billionaire egos in the technology world, it can be easy to get caught up in the game and ignore the fact that the winners are not always the good guys.

Take your pick of fun, child-focused movies. The Mitchells vs. the Machines, Ron‚Äôs Gone Wrong, Big Hero 6, even Pixar‚Äôs WALL-E 15 years ago, and it is a common theme. Big tech bros invent AI-based cool developments which humanity goes mad for, before learning that things were way better without them, and an unlikely hero saves the day with derring-do.. Between advances in AI technology and blue checks for anyone willing to pay the monthly subscription fee, a lot is happening on social media. Today (May 22), one of the most guarded government buildings in the nation fell victim to a hoax. A viral tweet claimed there was a massive explosion at the Pentagon.

This morning, multiple verified Twitter accounts, including one claiming to be affiliated with Bloomberg News, shared the AI-generated image via social media. The possible bombing of the ‚Äã‚Äãheadquarters for the United States Department of Defense caused widespread panic that resulted in massive consequences. According to The New York Post, after the image of the Pentagon exploding was shared internationally, even the stock market saw the impact. The Dow Jones dropped 50 points, allegedly within minutes.

@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon.

One major Indian television network even reported the incident and had a strategic expert join the broadcast to discuss the now-debunked bombing. In a statement to Forbes, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Defense called the image ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù The Arlington, Virginia Fire Department backed their claims, tweeting that they were ‚Äúaware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon. There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.‚Äù

The photo caused many to fear the future implications that could stem from situations like this one. ‚ÄúI think AI-fueled [misinformation] is going to become an exponentially larger issue in the coming years. Today, it‚Äôs a fake picture of a Pentagon explosion. Only a matter of time till someone posts a deep fake of our president declaring war on Russia or something vastly more harmful than what we saw here today,‚Äù one person tweeted.

Prime example of the dangers in the pay-to-verify system: This account, which tweeted a (very likely AI-generated) photo of a (fake) story about an explosion at the Pentagon, looks at first glance like a legit Bloomberg news feed. pic.twitter.com/SThErCln0p ‚Äî Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell) May 22, 2023

Earlier today an apparent AI-generated photo showed a fake explosion near the US Pentagon. The news was shared by Russian state-media RT on Twitter, which helped it go viral. It was also tweeted by a verified Twitter account called ‚ÄúBloombegFeed‚Äù which has now been suspended.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KN1wOptlRb ‚Äî Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) May 22, 2023

So @republic aired a 'Live & Breaking' news of Pentagon explosion image. They even invited Prof. Madhav Nalapat "strategic expert" to discuss about the explosion.

Confident that this picture claiming to show an "explosion near the pentagon" is AI generated. Check out the frontage of the building, and the way the fence melds into the crowd barriers. There's also no other images, videos or people posting as first hand witnesses. pic.twitter.com/t1YKQabuNL ‚Äî Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) May 22, 2023
