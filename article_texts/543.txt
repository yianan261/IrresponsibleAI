Between advances in AI technology and blue checks for anyone willing to pay the monthly subscription fee, a lot is happening on social media. Today (May 22), one of the most guarded government buildings in the nation fell victim to a hoax. A viral tweet claimed there was a massive explosion at the Pentagon.

This morning, multiple verified Twitter accounts, including one claiming to be affiliated with Bloomberg News, shared the AI-generated image via social media. The possible bombing of the ‚Äã‚Äãheadquarters for the United States Department of Defense caused widespread panic that resulted in massive consequences. According to The New York Post, after the image of the Pentagon exploding was shared internationally, even the stock market saw the impact. The Dow Jones dropped 50 points, allegedly within minutes.

@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon. There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public. pic.twitter.com/uznY0s7deL ‚Äî Arlington Fire & EMS (@ArlingtonVaFD) May 22, 2023

One major Indian television network even reported the incident and had a strategic expert join the broadcast to discuss the now-debunked bombing. In a statement to Forbes, a spokesperson for the United States Department of Defense called the image ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù The Arlington, Virginia Fire Department backed their claims, tweeting that they were ‚Äúaware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon. There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.‚Äù

The photo caused many to fear the future implications that could stem from situations like this one. ‚ÄúI think AI-fueled [misinformation] is going to become an exponentially larger issue in the coming years. Today, it‚Äôs a fake picture of a Pentagon explosion. Only a matter of time till someone posts a deep fake of our president declaring war on Russia or something vastly more harmful than what we saw here today,‚Äù one person tweeted.

Earlier today an apparent AI-generated photo showed a fake explosion near the US Pentagon. The news was shared by Russian state-media RT on Twitter, which helped it go viral. It was also tweeted by a verified Twitter account called ‚ÄúBloombegFeed‚Äù which has now been suspended.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/KN1wOptlRb ‚Äî Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) May 22, 2023

So @republic aired a 'Live & Breaking' news of Pentagon explosion image. They even invited Prof. Madhav Nalapat "strategic expert" to discuss about the explosion.

This morning, an AI generated image of an explosion at the US Pentagon surfaced. With multiple news sources reporting it as real, the S&P 500 fell 30 points in minutes. This resulted in a $500 billion market cap swing on a fake image. It then rebounded once the image was‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DpHgflkMXP ‚Äî The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 22, 2023

Confident that this picture claiming to show an "explosion near the pentagon" is AI generated. Check out the frontage of the building, and the way the fence melds into the crowd barriers. There's also no other images, videos or people posting as first hand witnesses. pic.twitter.com/t1YKQabuNL ‚Äî Nick Waters (@N_Waters89) May 22, 2023

Whoa, did you hear what happened this morning? An AI-generated image of an explosion at the US Pentagon spread like wildfire! The S&P 500 even took a hit, dropping 30 points in a matter of minutes.

Trending Stories. Generative artificial intelligence is often considered a threat to white-collar workers employed in the knowledge sector. But what about capital markets?

Investors got a taste of what may be to come after fake images of smoke billowing next to U.S. Defense Department headquarters spread via Elon Musk‚Äôs social media platform Twitter.

‚ÄúThere was a very brief selloff in markets yesterday after unconfirmed reports circulated on Twitter about an explosion near the U.S. Pentagon,‚Äù wrote Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs head of global economics and thematic research, on Tuesday.

‚ÄúGiven the suggestions that the initial photo might have been A.I.-generated, it just shows the potential pitfalls for markets if fake news driven by A.I. can cause concrete movements in asset prices.‚Äù

No one knows just who exactly created the images or why, but they were released at a time coinciding with the last-minute game of chicken over the debt ceiling playing out within Washington, D.C.‚Äôs Beltway.

That means investors are already on edge as they attempt to price in contingencies of a default that Moody‚Äôs argues will not spare any corner of the global economy.

Yields on the one-month Treasury bill maturing in June hit a record high of 5.9% after bondholders demanded a higher compensation in light of a potential missed payment by the federal government.

Musk‚Äôs attempt to crack down on fake accounts

Deepfakes have proliferated of late as virtually anyone willing to pay money to generative A.I. platform Midjourney can now quickly and easily publish deceptive images such as the Pope sporting an all-white Balenciaga puffer jacket.

But Monday‚Äôs brief selloff could be the first time generative A.I. has had a demonstrable effect on financial markets.

The episode could prove damaging to Musk, who has sought to portray Twitter as the most accurate source of information on earth by charging customers for verification.

‚ÄúThe goal is to make this platform maximum truth-seeking or, said another way, the least untrue compared to everything else,‚Äù he wrote at the end of April.

Musk, who purchased the social media company last year for $44 billion, has argued his premium subscription service Twitter Blue serves as an effective deterrent for bots and fake accounts since it ‚Äúsignificantly increases the cost.‚Äù

Twitter needs to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world. That‚Äôs our mission. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2022

That however has not proved to be the case, as numerous accounts have successfully impersonated people and brands, angering advertisers in the process.

Critics argue it is in reality an attempt to milk Twitter customers for much-needed revenue since all legacy accounts already verified lost their status if they refused to pay Musk.

Even if Monday‚Äôs market reaction was brief after the Pentagon confirmed there had been no explosion and the tweet was quickly deleted, a potential bad actor had plenty of time to pocket ill-gotten gains from manipulating the market‚Äîif that had in fact been the plan all along.

This threat ‚Äúcould be a growing issue over the months and years ahead,‚Äù Deutsche Bank‚Äôs Reid argued on Monday, ‚Äúparticularly if the technology is able to provide increasingly convincing images.‚Äù
