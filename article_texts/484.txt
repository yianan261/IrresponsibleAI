Washington (February 21, 2023) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) today sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) urging it to cease using its problematic CBP One app. DHS has required migrants seeking asylum at the southern border to use the app and submit sensitive information, including biometric data and precise location data, raising serious privacy concerns. The CBP One app has also suffered from technical problems, including facial recognition software misidentifying people of color. The app further presents barriers for asylum seekers who do not have cellular or internet access. The Senator’s letter to DHS also raises concerns that the CBP One app promotes the false notion that an appointment is required to seek asylum in the United States and the expectation of its expanded use once Title 42 restrictions are lifted carries profound long-term implications for the U.S. immigration system.



“This expanded use of the CBP One app raises troubling issues of inequitable access to — and impermissible limits on — asylum, and has been plagued by significant technical problems and privacy concerns. DHS should shelve the CBP One app immediately,” Senator Markey wrote to DHS. “Rather than mandating use of an app that is inaccessible to many migrants, and violates both their privacy and international law, DHS should instead implement a compassionate, lawful, and human rights centered approach for those seeking asylum in the United States.”



The letter continues, “Technology can facilitate asylum processing, but we cannot allow it to create a tiered system that treats asylum seekers differently based on their economic status — including the ability to pay for travel — language, nationality, or race.”

In the letter, Senator Markey requested that DHS respond to the following questions by March 10, 2023:

Will DHS commit to permanently cease using the CBP One application to screen asylum applicants? If not, why not, and will DHS at least temporarily stop using it until DHS can remove any biometric technology and geolocation functionality and fix the app’s technical issues? Will DHS ensure that there is an alternative means for migrants to seek asylum at the southern border, one that does not require an app or internet access? Currently, are asylum seekers who lack a smartphone or internet access — and therefore cannot schedule an appointment through CBP One — turned back when they present themselves at a point of entry (POE)? How is DHS preventing the CBP One app from discriminating against applicants of color, including the app’s rejecting photos of applicants with darker complexions? What assistance, if any, is DHS providing to asylum seekers whose photos are rejected, or who receive error messages or experience other technical problems with CBP One? Can migrants seeking asylum at the southern border still exercise that right without using the CBP One app? Before CBP One’s expanded rollout, was the application tested to screen for technology glitches or failures? If not, why not? Before CBP One’s expanded rollout, were civil society or nongovernmental organizations consulted? If not, why not? Why are only eight POEs participating in CBP One? How and why did DHS decide on this number and the specific locations? How many appointments does DHS make available each day through the CBP One app? In what geographic areas does the CBP One application work and how was this decided? How is DHS working with Mexico to ensure the safety of individuals who must travel in order to present themselves at one of the eight participating POEs? The CBP One app is available only in English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole languages. This makes the app inaccessible to asylum seekers who speak a different language. How did DHS decide on these three languages? What options are available for asylum seekers using the CBP One app who don’t speak those three languages? What steps is DHS taking to prevent exploitation of asylum seekers through clone apps or scam attempts? How is DHS defending against misinformation around the CBP One app? How is DHS safeguarding biometric and geolocation information obtained through use of the CBP One App? How is DHS ensuring that this information cannot be misused? Has CBP shared any personal information collected by the CBP One App with any other government agencies or law enforcement entities? If so please describe that sharing in detail.

Last month, Senator Markey sent a letter to President Biden calling on the Administration to reverse the expansion of Title 42 and abandon the proposed asylum “transit ban” rule. After the President visited the southwest border and met with Mexican President López Obrador, Senator Markey wrote to senior Biden administration officials sounding the alarm on paramilitary vigilante groups patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border and intimidating, harassing, and detaining migrants. Senator Markey is the author of the Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act, legislation that would prohibit use of biometric technology by federal agencies.

###. The US government’s new mobile app for migrants to apply for asylum at the US-Mexico border is blocking many Black people from being able to file their claims because of facial recognition bias in the tech, immigration advocates say.

Non-profits that assist Black asylum seekers are finding that the app, CBP One, is failing to register many people with darker skin tones, effectively barring them from their right to request entry into the US.

People who have made their way to the south-west border from Haiti and African countries, in particular, are falling victim to apparent algorithm bias in the technology that the app relies on.

Often disparaged within the already-marginalized population of people trying to migrate into the US, Black people within that group are now confronted with yet another hurdle.

Advocates are protesting that since the app’s rollout by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) last month, the algorithm problems are sharply reducing the number of Black asylum seekers who can fill out their applications.

The app is working for some migrants but blocking others, especially those who are most vulnerable, said Felicia Rangel-Samponaro, co-director of the non-profit Sidewalk School, which provides educational programs for asylum seekers in the Mexican cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, near the eastern end of the Texas border, where many Haitians are living in makeshift camps. It also runs a shelter in Reynosa with the church group Kaleo International.

“There are about 4,000 Black asylum seekers waiting in Reynosa and at least another 1,000 Haitians in Matamoros. Hardly anyone is getting an asylum appointment. Neither population is being represented as it should,” she said.

With the public health law Title 42 still in place as a result of the latest court ruling, and expanded last month to add Haitians, Nicaraguans and Cubans alongside Venezuelans as restricted nationalities, in yet another controversial turn in the Biden administration’s immigration policy, options for seeking asylum at the border have narrowed further.

The government announced in early January that the new CBP One mobile app would be the only way migrants arriving at the border can apply for asylum and exemption from Title 42 restrictions, saying it would “reduce wait times and help ensure safe, orderly and streamlined processing”.

In the Mexican city of Tijuana, at the opposite end the US-Mexico border, near San Diego, another large community of Haitian asylum seekers is waiting and experiencing the same problems with the app, according to non-profits that are assisting them, as are people from African countries and other Black migrants trying to enter.

“The facial recognition is not picking up [images] if people have darker skin tones,” said Erika Pinheiro, executive director at Al Otro Lado, a binational legal and humanitarian aid organization.

Pinheiro’s organization held a workshop for Haitians in Tijuana on how to use the app a day after it went live on 12 January. But with the app unable to map the features of many darker-skinned asylum seekers, they cannot upload their photos in order to receive an asylum appointment with the US immigration authorities, Pinheiro said.

“The Haitians at the workshop were getting error after error message on the app,” she said.

Rangel-Samponaro noted that others are being blocked, too. “We’ve also seen it affect Venezuelans who are darker-skinned,” she said.

Racial bias in face recognition technology has long been a problem. Increasingly used by law enforcement and government agencies to fill databases with biometric information including fingerprints and iris scans, a 2020 report by Harvard University called it the “least accurate” identifier, especially among darker-skinned women with whom the error rate is higher than 30%.

Emmanuella Camille, a staff attorney with the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a non-profit that aids Haitian and African asylum seekers, said the CBP One app has helped “lighter-skin toned people from other nations” obtain their asylum appointments “but not Haitians” and other Black applicants.

Besides the face recognition technology not registering them, there are other barriers, too. Many asylum seekers have outdated cellphones – if they have cellphones at all – that don’t support the CBP One app and often have limited or no access to the internet.

All three of the non-profits told the Guardian they have been in daily contact with US CBP about issues with the app. Last week, CBP introduced a Haitian Creole version of the app, Camille said. Before that it was only offered in Spanish and English.

Camille said migrants are “being told by CBP that the only way they can cross the border is by using this app … [It’s] the only source of hope for them right now.”Rangel-Samponaro said advocates were experimenting with ways to get the technology to work for darker-skinned asylum seekers. One fix they’ve come up with is installing bright construction lights at the shelter in Reynosa, which Haitians and others shine on their faces as they take the photo to upload to the app.

“So far it seems to be working, so the adults can get past that,” she said. “But it’s still not working for children under the age of six.”

This prevents families from applying for asylum.

“I’ve yet to speak with a white asylum seeker who has had the same issue,” she said. “And we help everybody in both cities.”

Another solution is that Black asylum seekers buy brand-new cellphones. “If you can afford to spend $1,000 on a new cellphone, then you can upload the image no problem. But who can afford that?” Rangel-Samponaro said. “Not anyone living in a migrant camp.”

CBP did not reply with comments before publication, after being approached with questions by the Guardian.
