ARTICLE TITLE: Deepfakes and AI-generated disinformation in the 2023 presidential elections of Turkey
Turkish opposition alliance presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu has urged citizens to stay indoors if he defeats President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey’s upcoming elections to avoid the risk of confrontation with “armed elements” loyal to the regime.

Kilicdaroglu issued the blunt warning in an interview with KRT television late on May 4 as the country prepared for a final week of campaigning ahead of May 14’s polling day.

“When we are victorious on the election night, all our citizens should stay indoors instead of rejoicing in the streets,” Kilicdaroglu said. “Some people might stir trouble, some people may be provoked, armed elements may take the streets.”

Kilicdaroglu—head of Turkey’s broadest ever opposition bloc, the six-party Nation Alliance, and formally backed by the pro-Kurdish minority People’s Democratic Alliance (HDP)—also said the opposition has intelligence that indicates it may be targeted on social media with deepfake video or voice records.

“They can make negative propaganda by changing the sound and images,” Kilicdaroglu said. “We’ve learned that they’ve made agreements with some hackers from abroad and made payments in Bitcoin.”

Two days earlier, Kilicdaroglu addressed Erdogan officials on Twitter with warnings against the emergence of a disinformation campaign, writing: “There are two days left until the final ten days [before the parliamentary and presidential elections]. Let me give my last warning. Fahrettin Altun, Serhat and their teammates Cagatay and Evren; The dark web world you are trying to deal with will lead you into the hands of foreign intelligence. Playing Cambridge Analytica is beyond your capacity, boys. LAST WARNING!”

Turkey’s communications minister, Fahrettin Altun, responded sharply on Twitter to the accusations against the group consisting of himself, his two deputies and Serhat Eroglu, head of the communication ministry’s data processing department.

“Kilicdaroglu has once again tried to defame our Directorate of Communication,” Altun said, “who work day and night for the strategic communication of our country and have achieved great success in the fight against systematic disinformation against our country.

“It is unacceptable for any politician who has embraced democracy to indulge in the politics of gossip and slander… we fight against disinformation, which we see as one of the biggest enemies of democracy, and inform national and international public opinion accurately, quickly and transparently.”

Responding to fears that there could be attempts to rig the vote to ensure he does not defeat Turkish leader of two decades Erdogan, 74-year-old Kilicdaroglu has told how the combined opposition has worked hard for more than a year and a half to assemble enough observers to have more than one in each polling station in the country of 85mn.

Kilicdaroglu—a quietly spoken former economist and civil servant who pledges to restore democratic freedoms lost under Erdogan and hopes for resounding support in these elections from the five million Turks who for the first time are old enough to vote—told the BBC last week that Nation Alliance would be vigilant, trusting neither the president, "nor his Supreme Election Council nor his judges".

On fears that Erdogan will not depart office quietly if he loses, he added: "We will retire him, and send him to his corner. He will step back quietly. No one should have any concerns about it."

Those not so certain that that will prove to be the case note various worrying comments in the past week, including remarks from Erdogan’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, in which he warned that the vote will be a “coup attempt by the West”.

Trailing Kilicdaroglu in the polls, Erdogan, 69, has stepped up his polarising rhetoric on the campaign trail.

“My nation will not surrender this country to the one who becomes president with the support of Qandil,” Erdogan told supporters in Ankara on May 1, referencing the Qandil mountains on the Iraq-Iran border where the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a 39-year insurgency against the Turkish state, has its main base.

Erdogan, who has also talked of making Kilicdaroglu a “political corpse”, has also gone on the attack with identity politics, talking of the opposition parties of being pro-LGBT. “We are not pro-LGBT, we are against LGBT. The Republican People’s Party [CHP] is pro-LGBT, the Good Party [IYI Party] is LGBT, and the Peoples’ Democratic Party [HDP] is pro-LGBT. Family is sacred to us.”

Underscoring the HDP’s endorsement of Kilicdaroglu, the jailed former co-leader of the party, Selahattin Demirtas, referred to him as “Turkey’s 13th President”, tweeting on May 3: “Turkey’s 13th President Mr. Kilicdaroglu, may God speed you. I sincerely believe that you will end factionalism, ensure social peace and bring Turkey prosperity and serenity. My vote is for you, Mr. #CumhurbaşkanıKılıçdaroğlu."

If the Erdogan camp does retain confidence that their man will triumph despite enthusiasm for Kilicdaroglu, that confidence is not so robust that they are content to ignore negative headlines in the international media.

The week closed with Erdogan’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, pulling an article he’d submitted to The Economist, after the weekly pictured “Save Democracy” and “Erdogan Must Go” pins on a cover devoted to the Turkish elections.

The British magazine described Turkey’s ballot as the most important election of 2023, adding in the cover story: “If Turkey sacks its strongman, democrats everywhere should take heart.”

Cavusoglu asked why the publication was “attempting to intervene in the internal politics of a country”, while Erdogan said in a Twitter post: “We will not allow our domestic politics to be directed and the national will to be swayed by the covers of magazines that are the operational apparatus of global powers.”. Not to sound too much like Kamala Harris during one of her peregrinations on the nature of time, but the thing about the future is that it catches up with you awfully fast.

For a while we have been warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence and the special hazards of ‘deepfakes’. It seemed so futuristic when we saw a deepfake of Barack Obama some years ago, which demonstrated how easy it was to put words into someone’s mouth that they did not say. Well, now we have had an example in real time. Or at least the electorate in Turkey have.

Personally I am not persuaded that Turkey’s election was ever likely to be entirely fair and free. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan once said that democracy is like a tram: you take it until it gets you to your destination – the destination, presumably, being such a time as elections become unnecessary. Never-theless the country did go through the election process this week. And despite a surprisingly knife-edge result, the most interesting thing was actually what happened a few days before the election, when a sex tape was released featuring one of the candidates – Muharrem Ince. The candidate immediately denounced the tape as a ‘deepfake’.

In the era of deepfakes, how is the voting public to know what is true and what is not?

I should stress at this point that I have not gone online to search out the tape in question and assess its provenance. All I do know is the candidate was swift to cite ‘deepfake’ in his defence. And not just deepfake, but dastardly, Israeli-originated deepfake. Ince was not content with simply denying the tape was real: it had to be the work of the Israelis.

This is a popular and common enough move in Turkey, as it is across much of the Islamic world. Get into a spot of bother and you can always claim that the Israelis are to blame. Some readers might remember that moment some years ago when Lord Ahmed of Rotherham killed a man on the M1 by accidentally hitting the victim’s crashed car just after he had been texting. Lord Ahmed received a short prison sentence for dangerous driving and subsequently cropped up on television in his native Pakistan explaining to an interviewer that his conviction had been overturned. (It hadn’t.) And that his harsh sentencing had, in fact, been down to the Jews. Lord Ahmed declined to elaborate on this point. In any case, this was explanation enough for Pakistani television. Though sadly for Lord Ahmed he could not blame the Jews when he was convicted some years later of child sexual abuse.

But I digress. Turkey’s presidential candidate seems to have imagined that hinting that the purported sex tape was not just a deepfake, but an Israeli deepfake, would go down well with the Turkish public. The tape was released just before the final polls. And in the candidate’s opinion this was a shame, because Ince – who also ran in the 2018 election in Turkey – said that he was offering Turkey ‘a third option, a third way’.

Instead of being able to offer the Turkish people this third way of doing things, though, poor Ince had to pull out – of the race that is. And it is probably all for the good. Because at present a couple of days is not enough for the world to determine whether a sex tape is the real article or a piece of mischief-making. I pity the candidate who would want to try to prove this point. After all, there are only two ways in which you can really get absolved in such a matter and have it swing in your favour.

The first is to invite the entire voting public to view the sex tape and decide for themselves whether it is the genuine article or not. The other is to have some sort of press conference, with an overhead projector and perhaps one of those laser pointer jobbies, the better to point to those portions of the tape which should be viewed with particular suspicion by the voting public.

My point is that this could be seen as almost the epitome of a lose-lose situation. Whichever way you go, you are merely solidifying the question of ‘sex’ and ‘tape’ in the minds of the voting public. Not something which is likely to be a vote-winner, unless you happen to look an awful lot like a swimwear model (which Ince does not). And quite possibly not even then.

But somewhere within this sorry modern tale is a deeper lesson. In recent years I have commented with some regularity that the treadmill of technological progress on which we are running is going at too high a speed for our legs to keep carrying us. Even before the era of deepfakes we were at risk of being thrown off the treadmill. Now perhaps we are indeed at the throwing-off stage.

For how is a voting public to know what is true and what is not? If something in any way scandalous dropped before an election in a more developed democracy, how would we be able to know whether the material was true or not? Would we trust our intelligence services to tell us? Would Americans?

How would a candidate be able to undo any damage that had been done in time to keep themselves in the running? And how to discern the difference between an unscrupulous candidate who is willing to say any old thing to get himself out of a tricky situation and actual deepfake interference? The public at large have enough difficulty agreeing on the first of these two, never mind with the additional challenge of the second.

I do not know how this will go. All I do know is that while Muharrem Ince no longer has to prepare for government, the lesson of his abortive political career is that we should try to prepare for the future that has already arrived.
