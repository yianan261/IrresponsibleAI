The target of his ire was Russia, long seen as an ally of his electoral opponent Erdogan. And analysts suggest such dirty tricks from Moscow would make sense. “Russia is definitely favouring Erdogan [in the election],” says Galip Dalay at Chatham House. “They have energy and grain deals. Putin can even meet Erdogan, head of a Nato country, and so say he is not isolated and that the Nato front is not united.”

Yet Erdogan subsequently suggested that his rival’s accusations of Russian interference were no more than a ruse to deflect attention from the real culprit. “One of the candidates withdrew,” he said after Ince stood down. “Of course, it is impossible to understand why. What did [Kilicdaroglu] come up with? A tape. How did he do that? All they know is tricks.”

And just as Russia has reason to back Erdogan, Israel – provenance of the doctored sex tape, according to its victim – may have reason to see Turkey’s president unseated. “There has been difficulty, real bad blood between Israel and Turkey over the past decade,” says Dalay. “One can assume Israel would back the opposition.”

Whatever the truth about foreign meddling, though, there is little doubt that the world is watching Turkey’s election, freighted as it is with stunning geopolitical significance. Turkey has long played what an intelligence source calls “the man in the middle” – trying to leverage its position as both a Nato member and a country with close ties to Moscow. It also has a critical role in controlling the flow of refugees into Europe and, despite Erdogan’s increasingly dictatorial instincts, remains a large Muslim democracy in a region hardly overflowing with them.

With the war in Ukraine, however, the stakes have got even higher, as West and East both try to bring the world’s 11th biggest economy further into their camp. “And Turkey,” says the source, “is trying to juggle both sides.” On one hand, Ankara is blocking Sweden’s accession to Nato and buying Russian gas, but on the other, “it isn’t turning a blind eye to weapons smuggled through Turkish territorial waters. And nor has Erdogan started arguing Putin’s case in the Western camp.”

Yet if the elections are vital for the world beyond Turkey’s borders, they are also critical for Turkey. The opposition claims they are a chance to restore the country’s battered economy, whose plummeting currency and soaring 40 per cent-plus inflation has created a cost of living crisis that has made many Turks dramatically poorer. Erdogan insists, however, that only he can prevent the restoration of a secular, metropolitan elite dragging the country from its cultural roots. Turkey, he says, can be powerful and prosperous without sliding inexorably Westwards.. Turkish opposition alliance presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu has urged citizens to stay indoors if he defeats President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey’s upcoming elections to avoid the risk of confrontation with “armed elements” loyal to the regime.

Kilicdaroglu issued the blunt warning in an interview with KRT television late on May 4 as the country prepared for a final week of campaigning ahead of May 14’s polling day.

“When we are victorious on the election night, all our citizens should stay indoors instead of rejoicing in the streets,” Kilicdaroglu said. “Some people might stir trouble, some people may be provoked, armed elements may take the streets.”

Kilicdaroglu—head of Turkey’s broadest ever opposition bloc, the six-party Nation Alliance, and formally backed by the pro-Kurdish minority People’s Democratic Alliance (HDP)—also said the opposition has intelligence that indicates it may be targeted on social media with deepfake video or voice records.

“They can make negative propaganda by changing the sound and images,” Kilicdaroglu said. “We’ve learned that they’ve made agreements with some hackers from abroad and made payments in Bitcoin.”

Two days earlier, Kilicdaroglu addressed Erdogan officials on Twitter with warnings against the emergence of a disinformation campaign, writing: “There are two days left until the final ten days [before the parliamentary and presidential elections]. Let me give my last warning. Fahrettin Altun, Serhat and their teammates Cagatay and Evren; The dark web world you are trying to deal with will lead you into the hands of foreign intelligence. Playing Cambridge Analytica is beyond your capacity, boys. LAST WARNING!”

Turkey’s communications minister, Fahrettin Altun, responded sharply on Twitter to the accusations against the group consisting of himself, his two deputies and Serhat Eroglu, head of the communication ministry’s data processing department.

“Kilicdaroglu has once again tried to defame our Directorate of Communication,” Altun said, “who work day and night for the strategic communication of our country and have achieved great success in the fight against systematic disinformation against our country.

“It is unacceptable for any politician who has embraced democracy to indulge in the politics of gossip and slander… we fight against disinformation, which we see as one of the biggest enemies of democracy, and inform national and international public opinion accurately, quickly and transparently.”

Responding to fears that there could be attempts to rig the vote to ensure he does not defeat Turkish leader of two decades Erdogan, 74-year-old Kilicdaroglu has told how the combined opposition has worked hard for more than a year and a half to assemble enough observers to have more than one in each polling station in the country of 85mn.

Kilicdaroglu—a quietly spoken former economist and civil servant who pledges to restore democratic freedoms lost under Erdogan and hopes for resounding support in these elections from the five million Turks who for the first time are old enough to vote—told the BBC last week that Nation Alliance would be vigilant, trusting neither the president, "nor his Supreme Election Council nor his judges".

On fears that Erdogan will not depart office quietly if he loses, he added: "We will retire him, and send him to his corner. He will step back quietly. No one should have any concerns about it."

Those not so certain that that will prove to be the case note various worrying comments in the past week, including remarks from Erdogan’s interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, in which he warned that the vote will be a “coup attempt by the West”.

Trailing Kilicdaroglu in the polls, Erdogan, 69, has stepped up his polarising rhetoric on the campaign trail.

“My nation will not surrender this country to the one who becomes president with the support of Qandil,” Erdogan told supporters in Ankara on May 1, referencing the Qandil mountains on the Iraq-Iran border where the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a 39-year insurgency against the Turkish state, has its main base.

Erdogan, who has also talked of making Kilicdaroglu a “political corpse”, has also gone on the attack with identity politics, talking of the opposition parties of being pro-LGBT. “We are not pro-LGBT, we are against LGBT. The Republican People’s Party [CHP] is pro-LGBT, the Good Party [IYI Party] is LGBT, and the Peoples’ Democratic Party [HDP] is pro-LGBT. Family is sacred to us.”

Underscoring the HDP’s endorsement of Kilicdaroglu, the jailed former co-leader of the party, Selahattin Demirtas, referred to him as “Turkey’s 13th President”, tweeting on May 3: “Turkey’s 13th President Mr. Kilicdaroglu, may God speed you. I sincerely believe that you will end factionalism, ensure social peace and bring Turkey prosperity and serenity. My vote is for you, Mr. #CumhurbaşkanıKılıçdaroğlu."

If the Erdogan camp does retain confidence that their man will triumph despite enthusiasm for Kilicdaroglu, that confidence is not so robust that they are content to ignore negative headlines in the international media.

The week closed with Erdogan’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, pulling an article he’d submitted to The Economist, after the weekly pictured “Save Democracy” and “Erdogan Must Go” pins on a cover devoted to the Turkish elections.

The British magazine described Turkey’s ballot as the most important election of 2023, adding in the cover story: “If Turkey sacks its strongman, democrats everywhere should take heart.”

Cavusoglu asked why the publication was “attempting to intervene in the internal politics of a country”, while Erdogan said in a Twitter post: “We will not allow our domestic politics to be directed and the national will to be swayed by the covers of magazines that are the operational apparatus of global powers.”. May 2, 2023

ANKARA — With just 12 days to go until Turkey’s fateful elections and as polls give a knife-edge lead to Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s top rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the country’s main opposition suggested on Tuesday that the ruling party was planning to try to sway the vote through deepfake audios.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with private HaberTurk television, deputy chairman of the main opposition Ozgur Ozel said they received a tip that government officials were in talks with individuals on the dark web to release some deepfake audios ahead of elections. “Some preparations are underway. … We have received a tip [in regard] to the production of deepfake audios and dissemination of these fake audios through the dark web,” he said.

Ozel’s remarks followed a cryptic midnight warning by main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who accused Erdogan’s communications czar, Fahrettin Altun, and three of his staff members of trying to strike deals on the dark web.

“Only 2 days left until the 10 final days. Let me issue my final warning,” the main opposition leader tweeted. “The dark web world which you are trying to strike a deal with will lead you to fall into the hands of foreign intelligence. Pulling a Cambridge Analytica is beyond your capacity boys! This is my final warning.”. Misleading AI-generated content could swing voters, AI experts say. Sunday’s presidential election in Turkey is the first major vote to face this challenge.

Turkish Internet users were surprised to discover that Kemal Kilicdaroglu, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main challenger in Sunday’s election, spoke perfect English in a video posted online two weeks ago.

“The apple of my eye speaks English too. I promise you grandpa, we’re going to make you president,” a Twitter user commented, sharing the video of the 74-year-old candidate. But two days later, the independent Turkish fact-checking website Teyit revealed the video had been fabricated.

According to Teyit, which means confirmation in Turkish, the AI-generated video didn’t intend to fool anyone and was initially posted with a disclaimer.

“I constantly experiment with AI to learn about new functionalities. I created Kemal Kilicdaroglu’s voice on AI and used it for an English version of his candidacy speech,” said @ytc06, who was the first Twitter user to share the video with his 11 followers before it went viral.

The recent boom in access to AI tools is fuelling these kinds of situations, according to deepfake specialist Henry Ajder.

“When something designed to be satirical is taken out of context, it can be mistaken as real, especially if you're talking to an audience that has certain biases,” he told Euronews Next.

“Famous individuals and politicians are particularly at risk because they do a lot of speaking to the camera, staying still, looking straight down the lens. That’s an easier form of video to manipulate than if they’re moving around and their profile is changing,” he explained.

Flooding social media with deepfakes

On the same day the doctored video of him speaking English was released - mostly earning him supporters - Kilicdaroglu warned his social media followers of possible election interference.

“Playing Cambridge Analytica is beyond your capacity, boys,” he told government officials on Twitter, referring to the unauthorised use of personal data and targeted campaigning on social media to swing the 2016 US presidential election.

The upcoming Turkish presidential and parliamentary votes could end Erdogan’s 20-year rule and alterthe country’s political landscape. They are also one of the first major elections to deal with such advanced AI.

“If you can flood sophisticated and very human-sounding speech on large networks and inauthentic accounts with one narrative, that could obviously play a role in taking over a sphere,” said Ajder.

That’s exactly what Internet users have been trying to achieve in Turkey. Over the last few months, Teyit has contended with a wave of tampered content and has debunked over 150 controversial claims relating to the elections, with eight alone on May 10. Many of these were deepfakes designed to mislead readers by accusing candidates (mostly from the opposition) of terrorism and incivility.

“It's easy to recognise that kind of content is fake, but it isn’t to people who no longer think critically,” Turkish AI expert Cem Say told Euronews Next.

The majority of Turks are polarised between Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, and polls currently predict an extremely close race between the two candidates.

The incumbent president’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has repeatedly taken stabs at its competitors, most recently at its biggest rally in Istanbul, on May 7, when an undisclosed edit of Kilicdaroglu’s campaign video was played on giant screens.

The deepfake version had added in Murat Karayılan, a leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - which is listed by several other countries and the EU as a terrorist organisation - clapping along to the opposition’s campaign song, while lyrics “come on, let’s all go vote” blasted from speakers.

In a video shared on social media, Erdogan asked an estimated 1.7 million supporters attending his rally “Would my national and local countrymen vote for these people?” before adding: “Look at this, it’s really important!”.

Another presidential candidate, Muharrem Ince, dropped out of the race on Thursday after the release of an alleged sex tape he said was a deepfake.

What I’ve seen in the last 45 days, I’ve not come across in the past 45 years Muharrem Ince Leader of Turkey's Homeland Party

The founder and leader of the centre-left, secular and nationalist Homeland Party, who was Erdogan’s main challenger in the 2018 election, said he had suffered “character assassination” throughout this year’s campaign.

“What I’ve seen in the last 45 days, I’ve not come across in the past 45 years,” Ince said in his resignation speech.

“Fake videos, fake pictures… they put my face on a video taken from an Israeli porn website,” he added, blaming the country’s journalists and public prosecutors for not protecting him from the “fury of slander”.

Experts like Say fear even more aggressive, last-minute tactics. “Deepfakes could be used on election day with the motivation to discourage people from going to the polls or to influence their decision,” he said, adding this would leave “no time for verification”.

What can be done?

With advances in artificial intelligence showing no sign of slowing down, debunking experts are in a race against AI content generators. Just as in Turkey, deepfakes created by official sources have started making their way onto the political scene in the United States.

After President Joe Biden announced he’d be running for reelection, the opposing Republican National Committee released an AI-engineered video depicting a dystopian future under a second Biden term. Experts already warn deepfakes will be one of the main challenges of the 2024 US presidential election.

“The detection side of things is a little bit depressing at the moment,” Ajder said. According to him, tools certifying the provenance of content are promising, but risk creating a media hierarchy: if real content isn’t certified, “people can dismiss it as fake when convenient,” he explained. His recommendation is to stick to media sources that are well-known and can do fact-checking.

That’s very tricky in Turkey, where 90 per cent of domestic media is under government control, according to the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders. This - combined with an October 2022 law that aims to limit “disinformation” - means very few outlets actually report on deepfakes in Turkey.

Anadolu, the Turkish government news agency, was accused of withholding the results of the 2019 Istanbul mayoral elections won by the opposition, and this month, a report by the OSCE’s election observation mission raised concerns over the impartiality of the country’s media regulation body, RTÜK.

Just days before the nation heads to the polls, Turkish independent media outlet 140journos’ post-election series is perhaps the most powerful at imagining what might come next - here again with the help of artificial intelligence. Published in March using the AI image generator Midjourney and the AI text generator ChatGPT, it offers two narratives for Turkey’s future.

The first story depicts a defeated and freshly retired Erdogan. “In the beginning, it was a bit difficult. However, over time, I took the opportunity to spend more time with my family, to be closer to nature and to spend more time for myself,” a bot impersonating the politician says, while photos of him having tea in a robe illustrate the post.

In the other narrative, Erdogan has never given up power and Turkey has become a Star Wars-style empire aiming to “build universal peace”.

To the question “What were the biggest challenges in achieving this success?”, the Erdogan-impersonating AI replies: “One of our greatest challenges was to keep up with the new order of the world and the universe, and to follow technological developments closely and constantly adapt to them” - a nod to the challenge all politicians now face with AI.
