A mall security robot called Knightscope K5 recently ran over a 16-month-old toddler while on patrol at the Stanford Shopping Centre in Silicon Valley.

While the boy, Harwin Cheng, didn't suffer major injury from the ordeal, the incident is likely the first of many if robots are going to become part of our daily lives, forcing both the public and the robot's creators to think about how to handle these situations.

According to a local report by Lilian Kim from ABC7 News, the incident happened on the weekend of 10 July as the Cheng family was walking down a corridor of the shopping centre. Then, out of nowhere, one of the security bots – which were introduced in the mall last year – struck toddler Harwin Cheng from behind, causing him to fall face first on the ground.

Instead of stopping or realising what happened, the bot – measuring in at 1.5 metres (5-foot) tall and weighing 136 kilograms (300 pounds) – ran over the child, scraping his leg and causing his foot to swell.

"The robot hit my son's head and he fell down facing down on the floor and the robot did not stop and it kept moving forward," Harwin's mother Tiffany Teng told ABC7. "He was crying like crazy and he never cries. He seldom cries."

Knightscope Incorporated – the company behind the bot – also issued a statement about what happened:

"A K5 Autonomous Data Machine (Machine Identification Number 13) was patrolling at a local shopping center when, at approximately 2:39pm PDT, a child left the vicinity of his guardians and began running towards the machine. The machine veered to the left to avoid the child, but the child ran backwards directly into the front quarter of the machine, at which point the machine stopped and the child fell on the ground."

The good news is that Cheng didn't suffer any long-lasting injuries. The bad news is that this sort of thing will likely happen again in the future as bots start interacting more and more with the public. In fact, the Cheng family says that a security guard – who came to help Harwin – told them of a similar incident that happened days before, though it didn't make it to the press.

For now, the mall has suspended it's robotic staff members until further notice.

The Knigthscope K5 bot is meant to patrol malls and other highly populated areas, alerting human security guards of any sudden changes or loud noises. Why hitting Harwin didn't trigger these sensors is still a mystery.

"The machine's sensors registered no vibration alert and the machine motors did not fault as they would when encountering an obstacle," the Knightscope team said. "Once the guardians retrieved the child and the path was clear, the machine resumed patrolling."

According to James Vincent from The Verge, the company is calling the malfunction a 'freakish accident', claiming the bot drove over 40,000 kilometres (25,000 miles) without incident. The K5 team has also reached out to the family, offering them a trip the company's headquarters so they can apologise in person.

"Our first thoughts are for the family and we are thankful there were no serious injuries," Knightscope chief executive William Santana Li told The Verge. "Our primary mission is to serve the public's overall safety, and we take any circumstance that would compromise that mission very seriously."

There is so far no word what will happen to the K5 bots that inhabit the shopping centre in the long-term, though this isn't the only time a robot has behaved badly recently. Last month, a robot known as Promobot IR77 escaped from a lab in Perm, Russia where it stopped in the middle of a local street, causing a traffic jam. Then, even after being reprogrammed twice, continued to try to get away somehow.

While accidents are to be expected with any new piece of technology, the recent injury will hopefully start a discussion over what to do when they happen and who is to blame.. For Silicon Valley toddlers who are learning to walk, there's a new lesson -- watch out for the robots.

A mother and father watched in horror as a security robot at a mall in California knocked their 16-month-old to the ground and ran over one of his feet. The family and the company that makes the robot have shared conflicting accounts of the run-in.

The Tengs headed to the Stanford Shopping Center Thursday afternoon with plans to buy their son new clothes. As they walked passed an Armani Exchange -- with their son several steps ahead -- they noticed a robot slowly approaching them.

Tiffany Teng said the robot ran directly into her son -- striking him in the head and knocking him to the ground. The robot continued forward, running over the boy's right foot.

"What is that thing? What is that thing!" Teng said she screamed as she tried to push the 300-pound robot off her son.

"I tried all my strength to push it back and make it stop, but it didn't," Teng said.

Then her husband intervened, pulling the crying child out from under the robot. She figured he had broken bones.

Knightscope, which makes the robot, said the machine veered to the left to avoid the child, but the toddler ran backwards directly in the front of the machine. Teng said her son was not capable of running backwards.

"Hearing a report that one of our machines may have injured someone is absolutely horrifying," said Knightscope vice president of marketing and sales Stacy Dean Stephens. "Our core mission is to ensure public safety, and we are taking this report very seriously."

X-rays taken after the incident were negative. The toddler has a scrape on the back of one of his knees.

The K5 robot stands 5 feet tall and resembles a squat white rocket. It is designed to patrol malls, campuses and workplaces. Cameras stream live video, and Knightscope says it can predict unusual and potentially dangerous behavior.

Tiffany Teng, who lives in San Jose, said she'd been to the mall many times but never seen the robot before.

"It didn't have a sign saying, 'Go away, do not touch,'" Teng said. "It looks just like R2D2, it's attractive."

She said a mall employee lamented that this was the second time in a week a child had been struck by the robot. Knightscope said this is the only report it has received.

A spokeswoman for Simon Property Group, which runs Stanford Shopping Center, said it is investigating the incident and its robots are docked until the investigation wraps up. It declined to say whether there had been another accident.

The run-in occurred in the heart of America's booming tech sector. It's a reminder of how robots are steadily making their way into everyday lives, bringing both good and bad. While robots can make businesses more efficient and improve some aspects of our lives, they will be prone to the same bugs as computers.

Knightscope claims on its website that the K5 can safely navigate around people and objects. It has nearly 30 sensors, but the small size of a toddler appeared to confuse it.

The blind spots of robots surfaced earlier this month when a Tesla sedan on autopilot didn't recognize a turning tractor-trailer, leading to a crash that killed its driver.

Stephens said Knightscope machines have run more than 35,000 hours and covered 25,000 miles. The company's first robot was released in 2013.

The company offered to let the Tengs visit the Mountain View, California, company to learn more about how the robot works.

"I don't know if my son is ready," Teng said. "He will probably see this robot and start crying.". Recommended Videos

The whole point of a security robot is to protect people and/or things, which makes a recent incident with one in the real world (in case you hadn’t realized we’d reached that level of “future” yet) that much more upsetting: A 300-pound, Dalek-shaped security robot knocked down a toddler and then proceeded to run the child over. Where are those AI safeguards we talked about, Google?

Despite its behavior, the robot in question is not an actual Dalek (as we know, those still have fleshy organisms inside and technically aren’t robots) but a Knightscope K5 security robot. Microsoft employs these same robots at its Silicon Valley campus, but tech headquarters have one notable difference—a general lack of children—from malls, which is where Tiffany Teng’s son encountered the robot.

Adults may, for the most part, be large enough for the robot to notice and avoid, or they may be aware enough to avoid it themselves, but a 16-month-old toddler enjoys neither of those advantages. When the Teng family went to the Stanford Shopping Center in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, the robot first approached them slowly before knocking into the child and then running over his foot and scraping his leg as Tiffany Teng tried to push it off. Luckily, her son made it through the incident with no serious injuries.

CNN reports that Knightscope’s account of the incident is a little different, saying the robot tried to steer to the side and avoid the child, but he ran backwards in front of it. Teng, on the other hand, insists her son isn’t capable of running backwards. Maybe he stumbled backwards after an initial glancing impact? The K5 is capable of recording video from four cameras around its body, but that doesn’t mean it captured everything entirely clearly—and either way, the robot shouldn’t have trouble avoiding a child. CNN also mentions that a mall employee said this was the second such incident involving a child, but this is the first one reported to Knightscope.

Stacy Dean Stephens, Knightscope vice president of marketing and sales, said, “Hearing a report that one of our machines may have injured someone is absolutely horrifying. Our core mission is to ensure public safety, and we are taking this report very seriously.” The company has extended an offer for the family to visit their office and learn more about the robot, but unsurprisingly, Teng isn’t enticed by the offer.

As robots become a more prevalent part of everyday life, we definitely need to work on making sure they’re not doing more harm than good. Safe navigation is a key issue, and there are technologies in the works, and surely more to come, that should help things along and hopefully avoid issues like this in the future.
