U.S. stock market crash lasting 36 minutes in May 6, 2010

The DJIA on May 6, 2010 (11:00 AM – 4:00 PM EDT)

The May 6, 2010, flash crash,[1][2][3] also known as the crash of 2:45 or simply the flash crash, was a United States trillion-dollar[4] flash crash (a type of stock market crash) which started at 2:32 p.m. EDT and lasted for approximately 36 minutes.[5]

Overview [ edit ]

Stock indices, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, collapsed and rebounded very rapidly.[5] The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its second biggest intraday point decline (from the opening) up to that point,[5] plunging 998.5 points (about 9%), most within minutes, only to recover a large part of the loss.[6][7] It was also the second-largest intraday point swing (difference between intraday high and intraday low) up to that point, at 1,010.14 points.[5][6][8][9] The prices of stocks, stock index futures, options and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were volatile, thus trading volume spiked.[5]: 3 A CFTC 2014 report described it as one of the most turbulent periods in the history of financial markets.[5]

New regulations put in place following the 2010 flash crash[10] proved to be inadequate to protect investors in the August 24, 2015, flash crash — "when the price of many ETFs appeared to come unhinged from their underlying value"[10] — and ETFs were subsequently put under greater scrutiny by regulators and investors.[10]

On April 21, 2015, nearly five years after the incident, the U.S. Department of Justice laid 22 criminal counts, including fraud and market manipulation against Navinder Singh Sarao, a British Indian financial trader. Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later.[11] These orders amounting to about "$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall" were "replaced or modified 19,000 times" before they were canceled.[11] Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned.[4]

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigation concluded that Sarao "was at least significantly responsible for the order imbalances" in the derivatives market which affected stock markets and exacerbated the flash crash.[11] Sarao began his alleged market manipulation in 2009 with commercially available trading software whose code he modified "so he could rapidly place and cancel orders automatically".[11] Traders Magazine journalist, John Bates, argued that blaming a 36-year-old small-time trader who worked from his parents' modest stucco house in suburban west London[11] for sparking a trillion-dollar stock market crash is "a little bit like blaming lightning for starting a fire" and that the investigation was lengthened because regulators used "bicycles to try and catch Ferraris". Furthermore, he concluded that by April 2015, traders can still manipulate and impact markets in spite of regulators and banks' new, improved monitoring of automated trade systems.[4]

In May 2014, a CFTC report concluded that high-frequency traders "did not cause the Flash Crash, but contributed to it by demanding immediacy ahead of other market participants".[5]

Some recent peer-reviewed research shows that flash crashes are not isolated occurrences, but have occurred quite often. Gao and Mizrach studied US equities over the period of 1993–2011. They show that breakdowns in market quality (such as flash crashes) have occurred in every year they examined and that, apart from the financial crisis, such problems have declined since the introduction of Reg NMS. They also show that 2010, while infamous for the flash crash, was not a year with an inordinate number of breakdowns in market quality.[12]

Background [ edit ]

On May 6, 2010, U.S. stock markets opened and the Dow was down, and trended that way for most of the day on worries about the debt crisis in Greece. At 2:42 p.m., with the Dow down more than 300 points for the day, the equity market began to fall rapidly, dropping an additional 600 points in 5 minutes for a loss of nearly 1,000 points for the day by 2:47 p.m. Twenty minutes later, by 3:07 p.m., the market had regained most of the 600-point drop.[13]: 1 At the time of the flash crash, in May 2010, high-frequency traders were taking advantage of unintended consequences of the consolidation of the U.S. financial regulations into Regulation NMS,[4][14] designed to modernize and strengthen the United States National Market System for equity securities.[15]: 641 The Reg NMS, promulgated and described by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, was intended to assure that investors received the best price executions for their orders by encouraging competition in the marketplace, created attractive new opportunities for high-frequency-traders. Activities such as spoofing, layering and front running were banned by 2015.[16] This rule was designed to give investors the best possible price when dealing in stocks, even if that price was not on the exchange that received the order.[17]: 171

Explanation [ edit ]

Early theories [ edit ]

At first, while the regulatory agencies and the United States Congress announced investigations into the crash,[18] no specific reason for the 600-point plunge was identified. Investigators focused on a number of possible causes, including a confluence of computer-automated trades, or possibly an error by human traders. By the first weekend, regulators had discounted the possibility of trader error and focused on automated trades conducted on exchanges other than the NYSE. However, CME Group, a large futures exchange, stated that, insofar as stock index futures traded on CME Group were concerned, its investigation found no evidence for this or that high-frequency trading played a role, and in fact concluded that automated trading had contributed to market stability during the period of the crash.[19] Others speculate that an intermarket sweep order may have played a role in triggering the crash.[20]

Several plausible theories were put forward to explain the plunge.

SEC/CFTC report [ edit ]

On September 30, 2010, after almost five months of investigations led by Gregg E. Berman,[41][42] the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint report titled "Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010" identifying the sequence of events leading to the flash crash.[43]

The joint 2010 report "portrayed a market so fragmented and fragile that a single large trade could send stocks into a sudden spiral",[25] and detailed how a large mutual fund firm selling an unusually large number of E-Mini S&P contracts first exhausted available buyers, and then how high-frequency traders (HFT) started aggressively selling, accelerating the effect of the mutual fund's selling and contributing to the sharp price declines that day.[44][25]

The SEC and CFTC joint 2010 report itself says that "May 6 started as an unusually turbulent day for the markets" and that by the early afternoon "broadly negative market sentiment was already affecting an increase in the price volatility of some individual securities". At 2:32 p.m. (EDT), against a "backdrop of unusually high volatility and thinning liquidity" that day, a large fundamental trader (known to be Waddell & Reed Financial Inc.[25]) "initiated a sell program to sell a total of 75,000 E-Mini S&P contracts (valued at approximately $4.1 billion) as a hedge to an existing equity position". The report says that this was an unusually large position and that the computer algorithm the trader used to trade the position was set to "target an execution rate set to 9% of the trading volume calculated over the previous minute, but without regard to price or time".[43]

As the large seller's trades were executed in the futures market, buyers included high-frequency trading firms—trading firms that specialize in high-speed trading and rarely hold on to any given position for very long—and within minutes these high-frequency trading firms started trying to sell the long futures contracts they had just picked up from the mutual fund.[25] The Wall Street Journal quoted the joint report, "'HFTs [then] began to quickly buy and then resell contracts to each other—generating a 'hot-potato' volume effect as the same positions were passed rapidly back and forth.'"[25] The combined sales by the large seller and high-frequency firms quickly drove "the E-Mini price down 3% in just four minutes".[25]

From the SEC/CFTC report:[43]

The combined selling pressure from the sell algorithm, HFTs, and other traders drove the price of the E-Mini S&P 500 down approximately 3% in just four minutes from the beginning of 2:41 p.m. through the end of 2:44 p.m. During this same time cross-market arbitrageurs who did buy the E-Mini S&P 500, simultaneously sold equivalent amounts in the equities markets, driving the price of SPY (an exchange-traded fund which represents the S&P 500 index) also down approximately 3%. Still lacking sufficient demand from fundamental buyers or cross-market arbitrageurs, HFTs began to quickly buy and then resell contracts to each other—generating a “hot-potato” volume effect as the same positions were rapidly passed back and forth. Between 2:45:13 and 2:45:27, HFTs traded over 27,000 contracts, which accounted for about 49 percent of the total trading volume, while buying only about 200 additional contracts net.

As prices in the futures market fell, there was a spillover into the equities markets. The computer systems used by most high-frequency trading firms to keep track of market activity decided to pause trading, and those firms then scaled back their trading or withdrew from the markets altogether.[45]

The New York Times then noted, "Automatic computerized traders on the stock market shut down as they detected the sharp rise in buying and selling".[27] As computerized high-frequency traders exited the stock market, the resulting lack of liquidity "caused shares of some prominent companies like Procter & Gamble and Accenture to trade down as low as a penny or as high as $100,000".[27] These extreme prices also resulted from "market internalizers",[46][47][48] firms that usually trade with customer orders from their own inventory instead of sending those orders to exchanges, "routing 'most, if not all,' retail orders to the public markets—a flood of unusual selling pressure that sucked up more dwindling liquidity".[28]

While some firms exited the market, firms that remained in the market exacerbated price declines because they "'escalated their aggressive selling' during the downdraft".[25] High-frequency firms during the crisis, like other firms, were net sellers, contributing to the crash.[26][27][28]

The joint report continued: "At 2:45:28 p.m., trading on the E-Mini was paused for five seconds when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ('CME') Stop Logic Functionality was triggered in order to prevent a cascade of further price declines. In that short period of time, sell-side pressure in the E-Mini was partly alleviated and buy-side interest increased. When trading resumed at 2:45:33 p.m., prices stabilized and shortly thereafter, the E-Mini began to recover, followed by the SPY".[43] After a short while, as market participants had "time to react and verify the integrity of their data and systems, buy-side and sell-side interest returned and an orderly price discovery process began to function", and by 3:00 p.m., most stocks "had reverted back to trading at prices reflecting true consensus values".[43]

Criticism of the SEC/CFTC report [ edit ]

A few hours after the release of the 104-page SEC/CFTC 2010 report, a number of critics stated that blaming a single order (from Waddell & Reed) for triggering the event was disingenuous. Most prominent of all, the CME issued within 24 hours a rare press release in which it argued against the SEC/CFTC explanation:[49]

Futures and options markets are hedging and risk transfer markets. The report references a series of bona fide hedging transactions, totaling 75,000 contracts, entered into by an institutional asset manager to hedge a portion of the risk in its $75 billion investment portfolio in response to global economic events and the fundamentally deteriorating market conditions that day. The 75,000 contracts represented 1.3% of the total E-Mini S&P 500 volume of 5.7 million contracts on May 6 and less than 9% of the volume during the time period in which the orders were executed. The prevailing market sentiment was evident well before these orders were placed, and the orders, as well as the manner in which they were entered, were both legitimate and consistent with market practices. These hedging orders were entered in relatively small quantities and in a manner designed to dynamically adapt to market liquidity by participating in a target percentage of 9% of the volume executed in the market. As a result of the significant volumes traded in the market, the hedge was completed in approximately twenty minutes, with more than half of the participant's volume executed as the market rallied—not as the market declined. Additionally, the aggregate size of this participant's orders was not known to other market participants. Additionally, the most precipitous period of market decline in the E-Mini S&P 500 futures on May 6 occurred during the 3½ minute period immediately preceding the market bottom that was established at 13:45:28. During that period, the participant hedging its portfolio represented less than 5% of the total volume of sales in the market.

David Leinweber, director of the Center for Innovative Financial Technology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, was invited by The Journal of Portfolio Management to write an editorial, in which he openly criticized the government's technological capabilities and inability to study today's markets. Leinweber wrote:[50]

The heads of the SEC and CFTC often point out that they are running an IT museum. They have photographic evidence to prove it—the highest-tech background that The New York Times (on September 21, 2010) could find for a photo of Gregg Berman, the SEC’s point man on the flash, was a corner with five PCs, a Bloomberg, a printer, a fax, and three TVs on the wall with several large clocks. A better measure of the inadequacy of the current mélange of IT antiquities is that the SEC/CFTC report on the May 6 crash was released on September 30, 2010. Taking nearly five months to analyze the wildest ever five minutes of market data is unacceptable. CFTC Chair Gensler specifically blamed the delay on the “enormous” effort to collect and analyze data. What an enormous mess it is.

Nanex, a leading firm specialized in the analysis of high-frequency data, also pointed out to several inconsistencies in the CFTC study:[51]

Based on interviews and our own independent matching of the 6,438 W&R executions to the 147,577 CME executions during that time, we know for certain that the algorithm used by W&R never took nor required liquidity. It always posted sell orders above the market and waited for a buyer; it never crossed the bid/ask spread. That means that none of the 6,438 trades were executed by hitting a bid. [...] [S]tatements from page 36 of Kirilenko's paper[5] cast serious doubt on the credibility of their analysis. [...] It is widely believed that the "sell program" refers to the algo selling the W&R contracts. However, based on the statements above, this cannot be true. The sell program must be referring to a different algo, or Kirilenko's analysis is fundamentally flawed, because the paper incorrectly identifies trades that hit the bid as executions by the W&R algo.

Academic research [ edit ]

"Order flow toxicity" (measured as CDF [VPIN]) was at historically high levels one hour prior to the flash crash

External videos Video of the S&P500 futures during the flash crash

As of July 2011, only one theory on the causes of the flash crash was published by a Journal Citation Reports indexed, peer-reviewed scientific journal.[52] It was reported in 2011 that one hour before its collapse in 2010, the stock market registered the highest reading of "toxic order imbalance" in previous history.[52] The authors of this 2011 paper apply widely accepted market microstructure models to understand the behavior of prices in the minutes and hours prior to the crash. According to this paper, "order flow toxicity" can be measured as the probability that informed traders (e.g., hedge funds) adversely select uninformed traders (e.g., market makers). For that purpose, they developed the Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading (VPIN) Flow Toxicity metric, which delivered a real-time estimate of the conditions under which liquidity is being provided. If the order imbalance becomes too toxic, market makers are forced out of the market. As they withdraw, liquidity disappears, which increases even more the concentration of toxic flow in the overall volume, which triggers a feedback mechanism that forces even more market makers out. This cascading effect has caused hundreds of liquidity-induced crashes in the past, the flash crash being one (major) example of it.

However, independent studies published in 2013 strongly disputed the claim that one hour before its collapse in 2010, the stock market registered the highest reading of "toxic order imbalance" in previous history.[54][55][56] In particular, in 2011 Andersen and Bondarenko conducted a comprehensive investigation of the two main versions of VPIN used by its creators, one based on the standard tick-rule (or TR-VPIN)[52][57][58] and the other based on Bulk Volume Classification (or BVC-VPIN).[59] They find that the value of TR-VPIN (BVC-VPIN) one hour before the crash "was surpassed on 71 (189) preceding days, constituting 11.7% (31.2%) of the pre-crash sample". Similarly, the value of TR-VPIN (BVC-VPIN) at the start of the crash was "topped on 26 (49) preceding days, or 4.3% (8.1%) of the pre-crash sample".[55]

Note that the source of increasing "order flow toxicity" on May 6, 2010, is not determined in Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O'Hara's 2011 publication.[52] Whether a dominant source of toxic order flow on May 6, 2010, was from firms representing public investors or whether a dominant source was intermediary or other proprietary traders could have a significant effect on regulatory proposals put forward to prevent another flash crash. According to Bloomberg, the VPIN metric is the subject of a pending patent application filed by the paper's three authors, Maureen O'Hara and David Easley of Cornell University, and Marcos Lopez de Prado, of Tudor Investment Corporation.[60]

A study of VPIN[61] by scientists from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory cited the 2011 conclusions of Easley, Lopez de Prado and O'Hara for VPIN on S&P 500 futures[52] but provided no independent confirmation for the claim that VPIN reached its historical high one hour before the crash:

With suitable parameters, [Easley, Lopez de Prado, and O'Hara] have shown that the [CDF of] VPIN reaches 0.9 more than an hour before the Flash Crash on May 6, 2010. This is the strongest early warning signal known to us at this time.

The node color indicates the inventory size of the HFT agent. When the market operates normally (left subplot), almost all of the HFT agents are in control of their inventory (greenish color). In crash period (right), most of the HFT agents gain large inventories (red) and the network is highly interconnected: over 85 percent of the transactions are HFT-HFT.[53]

The Chief Economist of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and several academic economists published a working paper containing a review and empirical analysis of trade data from the Flash Crash.[62] The authors examined the characteristics and activities of buyers and sellers in the Flash Crash and determined that a large seller, a mutual fund firm, exhausted available fundamental buyers and then triggered a cascade of selling by intermediaries, particularly high-frequency trading firms. Like the SEC/CFTC report described earlier, the authors call this cascade of selling "hot potato trading",[53] as high-frequency firms rapidly acquired and then liquidated positions among themselves at steadily declining prices.

The authors conclude:

Based on our analysis, we believe that High Frequency Traders exhibit trading patterns inconsistent with the traditional definition of market making. Specifically, High Frequency Traders aggressively trade in the direction of price changes. This activity comprises a large percentage of total trading volume, but does not result in a significant accumulation of inventory. As a result, whether under normal market conditions or during periods of high volatility, High Frequency Traders are not willing to accumulate large positions or absorb large losses. Moreover, their contribution to higher trading volumes may be mistaken for liquidity by Fundamental Traders. Finally, when rebalancing their positions, High Frequency Traders may compete for liquidity and amplify price volatility. Consequently, we believe, that irrespective of technology, markets can become fragile when imbalances arise as a result of large traders seeking to buy or sell quantities larger than intermediaries are willing to temporarily hold, and simultaneously long-term suppliers of liquidity are not forthcoming even if significant price concessions are offered.

Recent research on dynamical complex networks published in Nature Physics (2013) suggests that the 2010 Flash Crash may be an example of the "avoided transition" phenomenon in network systems with critical behavior.[63]

Evidence of market manipulation and arrest [ edit ]

In April 2015, Navinder Singh Sarao, an autistic[64][65] London-based point-and-click trader,[66] was arrested for his alleged role in the flash crash. According to criminal charges brought by the United States Department of Justice, Sarao allegedly used an automated program to generate large sell orders, pushing down prices, which he then canceled to buy at the lower market prices. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed civil charges against Sarao.[67][68] In August 2015, Sarao was released on a £50,000 bail with a full extradition hearing scheduled for September with the US Department of Justice. Sarao and his company, Nav Sarao Futures Limited, allegedly made more than $40 million in profit from trading from 2009 to 2015.[69]

During extradition proceedings he was represented by Richard Egan[70] of Tuckers Solicitors.[71]

As of 2017 Sarao's lawyers claim that all of his assets were stolen or otherwise lost in bad investments. Sarao was released on bail, banned from trading and placed under the care of his father.[72]

Sarao pleaded guilty to one count of electronic fraud and one count of spoofing.[73] In January 2020, he was given a sentence of one year's home confinement, with no jail time. The sentence was relatively lenient, as a result of prosecutors' emphasis on how much Sarao had cooperated with them, that he was not motivated by greed and his diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.[74][75][76][77]

Aftermath [ edit ]

Stock market reaction [ edit ]

A stock market anomaly, the major market indexes dropped by over 9% (including a roughly 7% decline in a roughly 15-minute span at approximately 2:45 p.m., on May 6, 2010)[78][79] before a partial rebound.[9] Temporarily, $1 trillion in market value disappeared.[80] While stock markets do crash, immediate rebounds are unprecedented. The stocks of eight major companies in the S&P 500 fell to one cent per share for a short time, including Accenture, CenterPoint Energy and Exelon; while other stocks, including Sotheby's, Apple Inc. and Hewlett-Packard, increased in value to over $100,000 in price.[8][81][82] Procter & Gamble in particular dropped nearly 37% before rebounding, within minutes, back to near its original levels.

Stocks continued to rebound in the following days, helped by a bailout package in Europe to help save the euro. The S&P 500 erased all losses within a week, but selling soon took over again and the indices reached lower depths within two weeks.

Congressional hearings [ edit ]

The NASDAQ released their timeline of the anomalies during U.S. Congressional House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises[83] hearings on the flash crash.[2] NASDAQ's timeline indicates that NYSE Arca may have played an early role and that the Chicago Board Options Exchange sent a message saying that NYSE Arca was "out of NBBO" (National best bid and offer). The Chicago Board Options Exchange, NASDAQ, NASDAQ OMX BX and BATS Exchange all declared self-help against NYSE Arca.[2]

SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro testified that "stub quotes" may have played a role in certain stocks that traded for 1 cent a share.[84] According to Schapiro:[85]

The absurd result of valuable stocks being executed for a penny likely was attributable to the use of a practice called "stub quoting." When a market order is submitted for a stock, if available liquidity has already been taken out, the market order will seek the next available liquidity, regardless of price. When a market maker’s liquidity has been exhausted, or if it is unwilling to provide liquidity, it may at that time submit what is called a stub quote—for example, an offer to buy a given stock at a penny. A stub quote is essentially a place holder quote because that quote would never—it is thought—be reached. When a market order is seeking liquidity and the only liquidity available is a penny-priced stub quote, the market order, by its terms, will execute against the stub quote. In this respect, automated trading systems will follow their coded logic regardless of outcome, while human involvement likely would have prevented these orders from executing at absurd prices. As noted below, we are reviewing the practice of displaying stub quotes that are never intended to be executed.

Trading curb [ edit ]

Officials announced that new trading curbs, also known as circuit breakers, would be tested during a six-month trial period ending on December 10, 2010. These circuit breakers would halt trading for five minutes on any S&P 500 stock that rises or falls more than 10 percent in a five-minute period.[86][87] The circuit breakers would only be installed to the 404 New York Stock Exchange listed S&P 500 stocks. The first circuit breakers were installed to only 5 of the S&P 500 companies on Friday, June 11, to experiment with the circuit breakers. The five stocks were EOG Resources, Genuine Parts, Harley Davidson, Ryder System and Zimmer Holdings. By Monday, June 14, 44 had them. By Tuesday, June 15, the number had grown to 223, and by Wednesday, June 16, all 404 companies had circuit breakers installed.[88] On June 16, 2010, trading in the Washington Post Company's shares were halted for five minutes after it became the first stock to trigger the new circuit breakers. Three erroneous NYSE Arca trades were said to have been the cause of the share price jump.[89]

On May 6, the markets only broke trades that were more than 60 percent away from the reference price in a process that was not transparent to market participants. A list of 'winners' and 'losers' created by this arbitrary measure has never been made public. By establishing clear and transparent standards for breaking erroneous trades, the new rules should help provide certainty in advance as to which trades will be broken, and allow market participants to better manage their risks.[90]

In a 2011 article that appeared on the Wall Street Journal on the eve of the anniversary of the 2010 "flash crash", it was reported that high-frequency traders were then less active in the stock market. Another article in the journal said trades by high-frequency traders had decreased to 53% of stock-market trading volume, from 61% in 2009.[91] Former Delaware senator Edward E. Kaufman and Michigan senator Carl Levin published a 2011 op-ed in The New York Times a year after the Flash Crash, sharply critical of what they perceived to be the SEC's apparent lack of action to prevent a recurrence.[92]

In 2011 high-frequency traders moved away from the stock market as there had been lower volatility and volume. The combined average daily trading volume in the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market in the first four months of 2011 fell 15% from 2010, to an average of 6.3 billion shares a day. Trading activities declined throughout 2011, with April's daily average of 5.8 billion shares marking the lowest month since May 2008. Sharp movements in stock prices, which were frequent during the period from 2008 to the first half of 2010, were in a decline in the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, the VIX, which fell to its lowest level in April 2011 since July 2007.[93]

These volumes of trading activity in 2011, to some degree, were regarded as more natural levels than during the financial crisis and its aftermath. Some argued that those lofty levels of trading activity were never an accurate picture of demand among investors. It was a reflection of computer-driven traders passing securities back and forth between day-trading hedge funds. The flash crash exposed this phantom liquidity. In 2011 high-frequency trading firms became increasingly active in markets like futures and currencies, where volatility remains high.[93]

In 2011 trades by high-frequency traders accounted for 28% of the total volume in the futures markets, which included currencies and commodities, an increase from 22% in 2009. However, the growth of computerized and high-frequency trading in commodities and currencies coincided with a series of "flash crashes" in those markets. The role of human market makers, who match buyers and sellers and provide liquidity to the market, was more and more played by computer programs. If those program traders pulled back from the market, then big "buy" or "sell" orders could have led to sudden, big swings. It would have increased the probability of surprise distortions, as in the equity markets, according to a professional investor.[citation needed] In February 2011, the sugar market took a dive of 6% in just one second. On March 1, 2011, cocoa futures prices dropped 13% in less than a minute on the Intercontinental Exchange. Cocoa plunged $450 to a low of $3,217 a metric ton before rebounding quickly. The U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen on March 16, 2011, falling 5% in minutes, one of its biggest moves ever. According to a former cocoa trader: "The electronic platform is too fast; it doesn't slow things down like humans would."[91]

In July 2012, the SEC launched an initiative to create a new market surveillance tool known as the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT).[94] By April 2015, despite support for the CAT from SEC Chair Mary Jo White and members of Congress, work to finish the project continued to face delays.[95]

Flash Crash (Announced) [98]

(Announced) Bloomberg Quicktake: The Wild $50M Ride of the Flash Crash Trader[99]. Hey look, they caught the guy who caused the flash crash of 2010! His name is Navinder Singh Sarao, and he lives in London and in 2009 he asked someone to help him build a spoofing robot:

Sarao was trading E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts, but he wanted a more convenient way to not trade them, so he e-mailed his FCM (futures commission merchant, i.e. broker) for help automating that. The idea is that he would put in a big order to sell a whole bunch of futures at a price a few ticks higher than the best offer. So probably he wouldn't sell any futures, since he wasn't offering the best price. But he had to keep constantly updating his orders to keep them a few ticks higher than the best offer, to make sure that he didn't accidentally sell any futures as the market moved. And that's a bit of a pain, so he programmed an algorithm to do it for him. Though he also seems to have done similar things manually, to support the algorithm's efforts, or to stave off boredom while the algorithm did its thing.. Kaja Whitehouse

USA TODAY

The arrest of a London trader who allegedly helped cause the 2010 Flash Crash isn't boosting investors' confidence. It's spooking them.

"If this one random guy could impact billions of market value in seconds or milliseconds, what's going on?" billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said in an interview.

"If a guy in his underwear can manipulate markets, anybody can. The optics look really, really bad," said Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team.

Investors from Wall Street to Main Street are expressing bewildered concern over Navinder Singh Sarao's alleged role in the Flash Crash on May 6, 2010, which caused the Dow Jones industrial Average to plunge nearly 600 points in five minutes.

The drop erased hundreds of billions in market value before the Dow inexplicably recovered minutes later. It left investors shell-shocked and sent regulators scrambling for ways to prevent such a dramatic plummet from happening again.

Sarao was arrested in London on Tuesday and said in court Wednesday that he opposed extradition to the USA to face charges.

Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading, which executes trades for large investors, called the details surrounding Sarao's arrest a "confidence-shattering event."

He questions whether other traders may be engaged in market-moving activities, and why it took regulators so long to catch on.

"I would like to hear from the (regulators) why did it go on for five years? And can they tell us confidently that there's no one else doing this currently?" Saluzzi said.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or CME Group, questioned Sarao numerous times about his trading in 2010, only to be brushed off, according to the Justice Department's criminal complaint against Sarao, unsealed Tuesday.

In March 2010, a few months before the crash, Sarao allegedly asked CME whether its questions about his trading meant CME was ready to go after "mass manipulation" by high-frequency traders, according to the DOJ.

In a statement, CME said it is reviewing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's claim, also released Tuesday, that Sarao was partially responsible for the crash.

"Following the Flash Crash on May 6, 2010, together with other regulators, we did a thorough analysis of all activity in our markets during the Flash Crash, and concluded — along with regulators — that the Flash Crash was not caused by the futures market," CME Group said in a statement. "If new information has come to light, we look forward to reviewing it with the (CFTC)," the statement said.

Sarao's alleged activities went from 2009 through this year and earned him an estimated $40 million in profits, said Aitan Goelman, head of enforcement at the CFTC. Authorities charge he manipulated a popular stock market futures index for his gain by placing large contract orders and quickly canceling them before they were executed.

Adding to concerns, the CFTC was alerted to Sarao's alleged misdeeds by a whistle-blower, who has not been identified, according to Shayne Stevenson, who represents the whistle-blower through Hagens Berman law firm in Seattle. Stevenson said his client brought "high-quality information" about "market manipulation" to the CFTC, which alerted the DOJ.

Stevenson declined to specify when his client went to the CFTC with the information.

One investor says the episode reminds him of the Bernard Madoff fraud case. Madoff, a securities broker, ran a Ponzi scheme that stole billions of dollars from investors. Regulators didn't catch on for years despite warnings, and the scheme finally fell apart in 2008 with Madoff's arrest.

"This reminds me of the Madoff scandal in that it took a private investigator to figure out what happened," said Stanley Haar, a commodities trader with Haar Capital. "Trading those huge volumes, this guy should have been caught within a week," Haar said of Saraoo.. At about 2:30pm on May 6, 2010, an asset management firm began executing a series of orders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Located in Overland Park, Kansas, Waddell & Reed was (and is) one of the oldest mutual fund companies in America. It followed a strategy based on fundamental analysis—Wall Street code for old-fashioned investing. That afternoon, it wanted to sell 75,000 futures contracts on the S&P 500, a major market index, before the market closed at 4 p.m. The order was large but basically unremarkable, and Waddell & Reed had been executing similar trades for decades.

But this time something was different. Within 20 minutes of Waddell & Reed’s initial order, S&P 500 futures had declined 5 percent, and individual equity prices began to oscillate wildly. The price of the consulting firm Accenture declined from roughly $30 to $0.01 in seven seconds. Consumer goods giant Procter and Gamble dropped from around $60 to $39. Shares of Apple tumbled 20 percent from their pre-crash price of approximately $250, and also traded at nearly $100,000 per share (trades which were later annulled by the exchange). The dramatic futures move and the massive and sudden dislocation in the equities markets on that day came to be known as the Flash Crash.

How did the Flash Crash happen? The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) arrived at one explanation in their official joint report, published in September of 2010. According to the report, many of the firms that bought the initial batch of futures from Waddell & Reed used automated trading software. Each purchase introduced additional market exposure and risk, prompting these trading programs to hedge their own risk by selling these same futures. Other automated traders took the other side of these trades, then also sought to offload their risk in the market. Each trade that Waddell & Reed made therefore caused multiple trades in response. In addition, Waddell & Reed had instructed their own trading program to trade no more than 9 percent of the total volume of the futures contracts traded at any given time, so that their algorithm didn’t trade too aggressively. But the algorithm wasn’t given any restrictions on price, or the time it should take to finish its order. It began to ramp up its own volumes exponentially in response to the activity that it itself had initiated, all the while maintaining its 9 percent volume cap. As the firms buying from Waddell & Reed accumulated risk, they began to require more incentive to continue buying futures. Prices began to fall. And since the different firms that were trading with Waddell & Reed’s orders also were generally using similar algorithms, their behavior became strongly correlated, pushing the markets in the same direction: down.

But then, almost as quickly as it had started, the crisis resolved itself. During the next few minutes, following an automatically triggered pause in futures trading, firms began to see the depressed market as a buying opportunity. Trading systems were reactivated and liquidity was restored. The market recovered to almost to its pre-crash level.

Some commentators remain skeptical of the SEC-CFTC’s official explanation. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the trades were executed, argued that a trade of the sort that Waddell & Reed had executed was too small, or too common, to explain such an extreme and unusual event. Firms like Waddell & Reed may make dozens, even hundreds, of similar trades without a hitch every year. Then just this past Tuesday, on April 21, a United Kingdom-based futures trader called Navinder Singh Sarao was arrested on wire fraud and market manipulation charges. He stands accused of placing large sell orders in S&P 500 futures without ever intending to have those orders fulfilled. Instead, regulators and prosecutors allege, his orders were intended to trick the market by increasing sell pressure on the futures. Regulators allege that the trick worked, making Sarao millions of dollars in profit. Furthermore, regulators have taken pains to emphasize that he employed this strategy on the day of the Flash Crash. His activity caused a sudden loss of liquidity and “directly contributed to the … price crash,” according to the CFTC’s complaint.

Like a nuclear power plant, modern markets are both interactively complex and tightly coupled.

So which explanation captures the dynamics that led to the crash? Could an ordinary order in the futures market or a lone market manipulator really cause the crash? The simple answer is that this is the wrong question to ask. From the perspective of the joint report and the enforcement action, the Flash Crash was a fluke, an idiosyncratic event caused by an unexpected glitch in the markets. But it was far from being a fluke. Instead, the Flash Crash reveals that we need a fundamentally different understanding of how modern financial markets work. We believe that it shows us that markets are governed by the same principle as earthquakes and avalanches: self-organized criticality.

A critical phenomenon is one in which changes in one part of a system reverberate throughout the rest of the system, allowing a small perturbation to trigger an extreme effect. In many systems, critical phenomena only occur under special circumstances, within a narrow range of parameters. In other cases, though, a system can exhibit “self-organized criticality.” This means the system can spontaneously depart from mild and predictable behavior and evolve to a state where critical phenomena begin to occur. It combines long stretches of predictability with bursts of radically different, unpredictable behavior caused by prosaic triggers—much like the market.

One well-studied example is the sandpile. Imagine sitting on the beach, slowly dropping grains of sand onto a pile. A given grain will land somewhere near the top of the pile and stay there. Gradually these grains will form a cone shape. The mathematics of how this sort of cone grows are well understood, and we can develop models that very accurately capture how sand piles grow. But sometimes something else happens, as Jordan Ellenberg describes in his Nautilus essay. A grain of sand will land on the pile, and then, instead of staying put, it will produce a chain reaction. It will hit a neighboring grain in just the right way to dislodge it; this second grain will hit another, again dislodging it; and so on, until there is a little avalanche. There is nothing special about the grain of sand that starts the collapse—it need not be bigger, or heavier, or fall in a different way from the hundreds of grains that just stay where they land. But it produces an outsized effect.

To see how small changes can reverberate through real-world systems, let’s turn to another disaster, the 1979 meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has studied the interactions that cause complex systems to fail catastrophically. He categorizes these systems along two dimensions: interactive complexity and coupling. Systems with a high degree of interactive complexity are prone to unplanned and unexpected interactions that are difficult to comprehend in real time. If such systems are also tightly coupled, it is difficult to recover from a failure, because it propagates quickly. The dynamics of such failures often mimic the evolution of systems into critical states.

Flashes of wildness are every bit as much a part of market dynamics as long stretches of predictability.

What started as an isolated pump shutdown at Three Mile Island—a relatively prosaic trigger event—cascaded into a series of failures that interacted in unexpected ways, including a stuck valve in an automatic safety system and a misleading control room indicator. All of these failures occurred without the system being “tuned” to any specific state: They were self-organized. The inherent impossibility of directly observing the dynamics of a nuclear reactor made it difficult for operators to diagnose the situation. And the underlying, tightly coupled nature of nuclear power provided an opportunity for the trigger event to be amplified. All this led to outsized consequences: a partial core meltdown.

Didier Sornette at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology has argued that market crashes are another example of self-organized criticality. Through Perrow’s framework, we see how the underlying structure of the market might lead to self-organized criticality. Like a nuclear power plant, modern markets are both interactively complex and tightly coupled. Their complexity comes, in part, from the layers of interacting technologies used by stock and futures exchanges, market data providers, and even the participants themselves, whose computers connect to exchanges to trade with proprietary and often closely-guarded algorithmic strategies. Likewise, markets are tightly coupled by the fact that market participants use models that rely on similar inputs and assumptions. Many firms also use the same class of safety checks to stop trading when things go wrong, which, as we saw with the Flash Crash, can amplify problems. The speed of trading in highly computerized markets also means that problems can evolve quickly, faster than operators can respond.

The analogy to sandpiles might also give us a hint about the origins of the Flash Crash. Just as any grain of sand can serve to start an avalanche, so could many factors have started the Flash Crash. In a self-organized critical system, the state of the system, rather than the precise characteristics of the trigger, is what matters the most.

Neither the Waddell & Reed sale, nor any single actor’s market manipulation, explain the Flash Crash. Indeed, if it were possible that the market could move 5 percent from a large order or the simple manipulations of one trader, we would expect such instances of extreme volatility to be much more frequent. Just as the sandpile can reach a state in which critical phenomena can occur organically, without any special preparation, so can the markets. This special sort of state happens rarely, which is why most of the time the market absorbs exactly the kinds of activities that have been cited as the cause of the crash. The important thing is that such states can happen, both in mathematical models of sandpile collapses and in real-world systems. And it is under these circumstances, when a system has evolved into a critical state on its own, that ordinary events can lead to something as extreme as the events of May 6, 2010.

This is why asking whether the Waddell & Reed sale, or the behavior of a manipulative trader, really caused the crash is a mistake. The disparate “causal” explanations of the crash can’t be reconciled with each other for a simple reason: They aren’t in conflict. The Flash Crash was an emergent phenomenon. Just as any grain of sand might cause the sandpile to collapse, and as Three Mile Island’s meltdown could be attributed to a failed pump, stuck valve, or operator error, the trigger for the Flash Crash could have been related to Sarao, Waddell & Reed, or something else entirely. The true roots were in the complexity of the system itself. The market was ripe for such an event.

In the years since the Flash Crash, the SEC has implemented measures to reduce tight coupling in the markets, and exchanges now pause trading if there are drastic price moves in individual securities. These measures help, but are they enough? The fundamental interactive complexity of the market and the unpredictable and difficult-to-observe interactions between software components, trading models, and market participants remain in place. Though we have avoided a repeat of the Flash Crash, similar events continue to occur. In May 2012, NASDAQ struggled to recover from a set of software glitches that delayed the Facebook IPO and resulted in hundreds of million dollars in alleged losses. The following August, Knight Capital, a major trading firm, dissolved after a software “glitch” caused them to lose almost $10 million dollars per minute for 45 minutes.

These flashes of wildness are every bit as much a part of market dynamics as long stretches of predictability. Focusing our attention on these long stretches of normal market behavior can be misleading, because they obscure the events that create the most important changes. Instead, we need to recognize that it is only by studying events like the Flash Crash that we can come to see how complex market forces interact with one another. The dominos are still there, self-organized by market dynamics that we do not fully understand and cannot directly observe or control. And we have no idea when they will topple next.

Five years ago, the global financial system was rocked by the “flash crash,” 15 minutes of chaos that shook the world’s biggest markets and prompted investors both big and small to question how such a vital part of the economy could be brought to its knees.

On Tuesday, United States prosecutors said that much of the blame for the event could be pinned on a single person: a 36-year-old man who had been boldly manipulating markets from his suburban rowhouse just a few minutes from Heathrow Airport outside London, where he was arrested.

Regulators said that their prosecution of the trader, Navinder Singh Sarao, demonstrated their aggressiveness in rooting out market manipulation. But news of the arrest, if anything, has raised anew concerns about how an individual could manage to exert such influence over the world’s financial markets. The case also played into worries that have swirled around the increasingly automated and complex financial markets, where regulators have struggled to keep up with nimble new participants like high-frequency trading firms that use sophisticated networks to make money in milliseconds via rapid-fire trades.

For the latest case, it took the authorities five years to track down a rogue actor making enormous trades. And, they were led to him only with the help of an outside whistle-blower.. . The great flash crash of 2010: What happened to the Dow Jones and what is Navinder Singh Sarao supposed to have done?

British trader Navinder Singh Sarao has been arrested, charged and is facing extradition to the United States over his role in the "flash crash". Sarao has appeared before Westminster Magistrates and has said he will contest this.

It started in the early afternoon of 6 May 2010, as panicked investors watched the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge around nine per cent in a matter of seconds. And the most terrifying thing was nobody really knew why.

The Dow had recovered a large part of its losses by the time markets closed. However, the 1,000 point dive is still the index's second-largest point swing, and its biggest one-day intra-day decline ever.

Some stocks suffered huge price swings, with the share prices of two companies in particular – Procter & Gamble and 3M – falling 36 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.

So what happened on the day of the "flash crash"?

8.00am – Stock markets open slightly lower on ongoing concerns over the financial situation in Greece, as well as uncertainty emanating from elections in the UK, and the upcoming jobs report.

The United States' Securities and Exchange Commission and its Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) subsequently issued a joint report on the "flash crash" of May 6th.

The report blamed the crash on a large sell order for "e-mini" futures on the S&P 500 by a mutual fund. These are a financial product which reflect investor confidence for the future performance of the S&P 500.

It said the order placed that day was so large it overwhelmed the market, as there weren't enough available buyers, and consequently liquidity evaporated, causing prices to plummet.

How does Navinder Singh Sarao fit into this?

The CFTC has alleged Sarao's financial trading company had been entering into and subsequently withdrawing from thousands of orders in a bid to depress the price of the "e-mini" futures on the S&P 500. When the prices fell he swooped, buying them up, and profiting accordingly.

They say his behaviour contributed to the fact that, when a huge trade was executed over in the United States, there wasn't enough liquidity, and the market was unable to handle it.. Nearly five years after the so-called “flash crash”—when the market dropped hundreds of points in the span of a few minutes on May 6, 2010—authorities have arrested a trader that they believe helped cause the swoon.

But the alleged culprit, a U.K.-based futures trader named Navinder Singh Sarao, didn’t actually make a whole lot of money off the flash crash, according to the U.S. Justice Department’s criminal complaint against Sarao.

The complaint, which accuses Sarao of manipulating market prices by fraudulently trading S&P 500 futures contracts, says that he netted $879,018 in profits on the day of the crash.

But that was a relatively small haul compared to Sarao’s gains on other days where he used the same strategy, according to the indictment. For example, more than a year later, on August 4, 2011, Sarao allegedly reaped more than $4 million by manipulating the prices of the same kinds of contracts.

Sarao’s strategy, described in the 35-page complaint by FBI special agent Gregory Laberta, involved placing large orders for electronic S&P 500 futures contracts known as “E-minis,” only to cancel them before the orders were actually executed. The practice is known as “spoofing” and it is illegal.

Using automated trading software, Sarao allegedly placed repeat bogus orders to sell huge blocks of E-minis, artificially pushing the market price of the futures contracts down. Once the price dropped, he would then execute real trades to buy the contracts at the lower price, while simultaneously cancelling his original sell orders. Next, he would turn around and use spoofing to drive the price of the contracts back up, actually selling some at the higher price while cancelling the rest of his fake orders.

Between 2010 and 2014, Sarao made a total of roughly $40 million using that strategy—and he was still actively spoofing through at least the first week of April, according to a separate civil complaint against Sarao by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

But if Sarao’s actions really did lead to the flash crash, it’s unclear why they only caused a single one—especially when that wasn’t even his biggest windfall amid a long-running scheme.

Indeed, Sarao’s conduct on the day of the flash crash actually seems pretty ordinary for him, by the FBI agent’s account. Over a period of two hours starting in the early afternoon New York time, when the Dow was down by more than 300 points, Sarao allegedly traded more than 62,000 E-mini contracts worth $3.5 billion. But for him that was nothing: The previous day he’d traded E-minis worth more than double that amount (or $7.6 billion); the day after the flash crash, he traded some $8.7 billion of them. (According to an email Sarao sent in 2012, cited in the complaint, the trader bragged that he “made the majority of [his] net worth” in “no more than 20 days trading.”)

Still, the day of the flash crash, Sarao’s spoof orders somehow created an “extreme order book imbalance” on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the primary place where E-minis are traded. During the two-hour period just before the flash crash, as much as 29% (or nearly a third) of the sell orders on the exchange were coming from Sarao, according to the criminal complaint. At that time, there was “little liquidity left in the market,” as there were more than twice as many sell orders as buy orders for E-mini futures contracts, the complaint says.

And that’s when the market went into free fall—triggering the “flash crash” at about 2:45 p.m. As investors (or their algorithmic trading programs) noticed what appeared to be a major fire sale of E-minis, the sell-off “spilled into equities markets” as traders dumped stock: The Dow shed another 600 points in a matter of five minutes, and was briefly down by 1000 points.

And if E-minis trading had caused the crash, all it took was a quick timeout to stop the chaos: the CME halted trading in E-minis for five seconds, and the market mostly recovered by 3 p.m.

The very next day, it was rinse-and-repeat for Sarao, who kept up his spoofing routine as though nothing ever happened, according to the complaint. So why hasn’t there been another flash crash since (other than the brief 2013 swoon following a hoax tweet about a White House attack)?

One theory is that it wasn’t just Sarao, but a confluence of spoof traders or price manipulators who caused the market imbalance; Sarao is simply the only one—or perhaps just the first—to get caught. It just may take another flash crash for government regulators to find the others.

. The flash crash has proven one of the most mysterious market events in recent history. Many observers still believe the event hasn't been fully investigated. Their view is fueled in part by new allegations that a London trader's manipulative trading helped set up the market for a crash that day.

Scroll down to see how the day unfolded.. On May 6, 2010, at approximately 2:32 pm EST, all three U.S. stock indices–The Dow Jones Industrial Index, S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite–underwent a massive plunge and a partial rebound over a 36-minute period.

In just a matter of minutes, the Dow Jones logged its second largest intraday drop, crashing 998.5 points (9%) before rapidly bouncing back. Sh
