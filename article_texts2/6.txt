. It’s easy to think up a business idea that’s already common in the marketplace, but coming up with a unique business idea takes courage and patience. To get started, ask yourself which innovations could positively impact your life. What is an issue affecting you or your loved ones? Once you’ve identified a problem and created a solution, your idea could prove valuable to a large audience, meet significant demand and lead to a successful business.

Uncommon business ideas tend to fill a void or address an overlooked niche. The following 12 examples demonstrate that game-changing companies can solve problems, generate innovation and be highly profitable. Use this list as a jumping-off point to brainstorm your unique business idea.

Disaster and emergency preparedness kit assembly and delivery Amid climate change and natural and human-made disasters worldwide, starting a business that provides disaster and emergency preparedness kits is unusual yet sure to find an audience. For example, Ready To Go Survival was launched in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy to provide personalized kits for anybody anticipating a disaster. Since then, the company has added additional resources, including survival consulting, survival gear, educational blog posts, skill-building tools and disaster research.

Plant consultant Have a green thumb? Help other plant owners keep their greens healthy and thriving. For example, Nick Cutsumpas, better known as Farmer Nick, has provided exactly this type of consulting to people in New York City, alongside other plant-friendly services such as in-person plant shopping assistance. Farmer Nick has built an email list of “plant parents” eager to receive tools and insights via his newsletter. He also has a blog that provides a wealth of information and resources, plant-coaching services, images of client installations, and more.

Homemade meal kit creation and local delivery Many people can’t get to the grocery store or are too overwhelmed with work and family obligations to prepare the fresh, healthy meals they’d like to provide for their families. If you have kitchen prowess, consider turning your passion into a passive income source that also provides a service to the community. Several meal kit brands, such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh, have long offered similar services via online subscription models, but your unique business idea can help you forge lasting bonds with people in your area. Did You Know? Did you know Blue Apron and similar businesses are also unique delivery services that embrace mobile apps and online selling to bring additional convenience to customers.

E-commerce that gets even The online business I Do Now I Don’t started from what might initially seem like a niche concern: Its founder experienced a failed engagement and tried selling the $10,000 ring back to their jeweler, who offered only $3,500. I Do Now I Don’t is now an e-commerce site that sells gently used jewelry and other accessories. Typically, the company offers sellers more money and buyers lower prices than traditional jewelry stores by eliminating the middleman – and driving sellers’ earning potential alongside the business.

Party (cleanup) committee It’s no surprise that most people don’t want to clean their homes after a night of revelry. That’s where Hangover Helpers comes in. This company takes care of your post-party chaos and even provides breakfast (with your choice of “grease” or “green”) to ensure you’re feeling your best – without the added mess. As innovative business ideas go, this seemingly niche service is in high demand among all regions and demographics, and it requires straightforward skills like cooking, cleaning and organization.

Package-free shopping Consumers are increasingly concerned about wasted resources in the food packaging process. Cardboard, plastic, Styrofoam and twist ties are sometimes not recyclable, leading to environmental waste. In response, Package Free Shop, a zero-waste pop-up shop in New York City, offers convenient and simple alternatives to single-use plastic products. The company also offers to ship its products with absolutely no plastic. Since opening, the company estimates that it has kept 48 million plastic straws, 132 million plastic bags, 674,000 plastic razors and 3.8 billion plastic water bottles out of landfills. This is an admirable achievement and plays to a growing market of consumers who want sustainable products and packaging. Key Takeaway Key takeaway When you make sustainability part of your business model, you make decisions with sustainability in mind for every business facet to encourage lasting, meaningful change.

Online baking If you love baking and have the creative flair for selling yourself, an online bakery business like Santa Barbara’s Big Red Baking Company could be a great way to stand out and make money. Conducting business online helps aspiring bakers connect with customers without having to rent commercial baking space. With social media apps like Instagram and TikTok, you can really show off your baking chops and attract hungry customers, especially as mobile and social media shopping continue to grow. When you bring your baking business idea to life, you’ll need to understand and adhere to your state’s food business laws and ensure your health standards are up to code.

Flexible, shareable workspaces Every day, technology makes it possible for employees and entrepreneurs to run their businesses and get the job done from anywhere. Businesses don’t necessarily have to rent office space or buy a building anymore. For example, WeWork provides office space for the officeless, with flexible, month-to-month membership options for individual freelancers and large companies. Freelancers who prefer to work outside their homes can have a more reliable workspace than a local coffee shop, and companies and other teams can have a place to collaborate and hold meetings and events.

Online education a la carte Do you ever wish you could go back to school or teach a course in a subject in which you’re skilled? Skillshare, founded in 2011, makes both of these goals possible. The company allows experts to teach online courses on a subject they choose via short videos, while students can watch classes at their own pace and use the community to get feedback. Students can also take classes offline via smartphones and tablets if they want to learn on the go. Unlike the high tuition rates of college or graduate school, Skillshare costs $99 per year. Half of that fee goes to pay the company’s teachers, so if you’re an expert in something, it’s a great way to make some extra money.

Why did Microsoft’s chatbot Tay fail, and what does it mean for Artificial Intelligence studies? Botego Inc · Follow Published in Botego blog · 5 min read · Mar 25, 2016 -- 2 Listen Share

Yesterday, something that looks like a big failure has happened: Microsoft’s chatbot Tay has been taken offline after a series of offending tweets. And here’s how the social media has responded:

Keywords associated with "Artificial Intelligence" throughout the day. "Microsoft" and "dangerous" are on the rise.

We will not mention the racist and otherwise offensive content that Tay learned from people, as it’s not as newsworthy as it seems… Especially considering that it’s so easy to "teach" and ask her to repeat something.

Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s official website "tay.ai" to see how they describe Tay’s objectives… The first thing we notice is that, Microsoft wants you to not take it too seriously, because On Tay’s Twitter account, they provided a link to Tay’s "about" page -that lists the following frequently asked questions-, rather than the regular home page.

"Entertainment purposes only"

The FAQ page seems to be far from covering what people really want to know about Tay, but one thing is clear: Tay doesn’t claim to be a smart bot capable of reasoning. She just wants to have small talk with youngsters.

And here’s a list of "Things to do with Tay". (Along with the sad "Going offline for a while" message with a black background.)

Is this really what 18 to 24 year olds expect from a chatbot?

We know by (9 years of) experience that, the most important thing to do before releasing a chatbot is to plan a strategy to make sure you communicate the content domain properly, so that you can set the expectations right. Since perception is everything, nothing else matters. Remember the success of the YO! app? That’s the content domain we’re talking about. As long as people get it, you can get away with just one word.

Title of the website, apparently wasn’t enough to convey Tay’s mission:

Tay is an artificial intelligence chat bot designed to engage and entertain through casual and playful conversation

Some more description from the "about" page:

Tay has been built by mining relevant public data and by using AI and editorial developed by a staff including improvisational comedians. Public data that’s been anonymized is Tay’s primary data source. That data has been modeled, cleaned and filtered by the team developing Tay.

Noticed the "comedians" part? And the fact that possibly terrabytes of data being cleaned and filtered manually, sounds problematic, even with the most efficient method one can imagine.

Let’s take a look at what her conversations were all about. Source: foller.me

Tay has only 3 tweets addressing all her followers. 96.000 tweets are mentions.

So, the keyword cloud seems to be consistent with the goal: Common keywords such as "chattin, pix, selfie, pics, omg, love" represents a mixture of Justin Bieber & Kim Kardashian profiles.

And here’s the three hashtags that Tay has been using so frequently:

Microsoft engineers don’t seem to have spent much time coming up with creative hashtags.

The way she uses them, didn’t make sense to us, though. So this is what Microsoft thinks Tay’s followers would find entertaining?. Microsoft’s attempt to converse with millennials using an artificial intelligence bot plugged into Twitter made a short-lived return on Wednesday, before bowing out again in some sort of meltdown.



The learning experiment, which got a crash-course in racism, Holocaust denial and sexism courtesy of Twitter users, was switched back on overnight and appeared to be operating in a more sensible fashion. Microsoft had previously gone through the bot’s tweets and removed the most offensive and vowed only to bring the experiment back online if the company’s engineers could “better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values”.

However, at one point Tay tweeted about taking drugs, in front of the police, no less.

Tay then started to tweet out of control, spamming its more than 210,000 followers with the same tweet, saying: “You are too fast, please take a rest …” over and over.

I guess they turned @TayandYou back on... it's having some kind of meltdown. pic.twitter.com/9jerKrdjft — Michael Oman-Reagan (@OmanReagan) March 30, 2016

Microsoft responded by making Tay’s Twitter profile private, preventing anyone from seeing the tweets, in effect taking it offline again.



Tay is made in the image of a teenage girl and is designed to interact with millennials to improve its conversational skills through machine-learning. Sadly it was vulnerable to suggestive tweets, prompting unsavoury responses.

This isn’t the first time Microsoft has launched public-facing AI chatbots. Its Chinese XiaoIce chatbot successfully interacts with more than 40 million people across Twitter, Line, Weibo and other sites but the company’s experiments targeting 18- to 24-year-olds in the US on Twitter has resulted in a completely different animal.. Microsoft has said it is “deeply sorry” for the racist and sexist Twitter messages generated by the so-called chatbot it launched this week.



The company released an official apology after the artificial intelligence program went on an embarrassing tirade, likening feminism to cancer and suggesting the Holocaust did not happen.

The bot, known as Tay, was designed to become “smarter” as more users interacted with it. Instead, it quickly learned to parrot a slew of anti-Semitic and other hateful invective that human Twitter users fed the program, forcing Microsoft Corp to shut it down on Thursday .

Following the disastrous experiment, Microsoft initially only gave a terse statement, saying Tay was a “learning machine” and “some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of the types of interactions some people are having with it.”

But the company on Friday admitted the experiment had gone badly wrong. It said in a blog post it would revive Tay only if its engineers could find a way to prevent Web users from influencing the chatbot in ways that undermine the company’s principles and values.



“We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay,” wrote Peter Lee, Microsoft’s vice president of research.

Microsoft created Tay as an experiment to learn more about how artificial intelligence programs can engage with Web users in casual conversation. The project was designed to interact with and “learn” from the young generation of millennials.

Tay began its short-lived Twitter tenure on Wednesday with a handful of innocuous tweets.

c u soon humans need sleep now so many conversations today thx💖 — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 24, 2016

Then its posts took a dark turn.

In one typical example, Tay tweeted: “feminism is cancer,” in response to another Twitter user who had posted the same message.

Lee, in the blog post, called web users’ efforts to exert a malicious influence on the chatbot “a coordinated attack by a subset of people.”

“Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack,” Lee wrote. “As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images.”

Microsoft has deleted all but three of Tay’s tweets.

Microsoft has enjoyed better success with a chatbot called XiaoIce that the company launched in China in 2014. XiaoIce is used by about 40 million people and is known for “delighting with its stories and conversations,” according to Microsoft.

As for Tay? Not so much.

“We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity,” Lee wrote.

Reuters contributed to this report. When Tay started its short digital life on March 23, it just wanted to gab and make some new friends on the net. The chatbot, which was created by Microsoft’s Research department, greeted the day with an excited tweet that could have come from any teen: “hellooooooo w🌎rld!!!”

Within a few hours, though, Tay’s optimistic, positive tone had changed. “Hitler was right I hate the jews,” it declared in a stream of racist tweets bashing feminism and promoting genocide. Concerned about their bot’s rapid radicalization, Tay’s creators shut it down after less than 24 hours of existence.

Microsoft had unwittingly lowered their burgeoning artificial intelligence into — to use the parlance of the very people who corrupted her — a virtual dumpster fire. The resulting fiasco showed both A.I.’s shortcomings and the lengths to which people will go to ruin something.

Hypothesis

Microsoft has, understandably, been reluctant to talk about Tay. The company turned down Inverse’s repeated attempts to speak with the team behind Tay.

The idea behind Tay, which wasn’t Microsoft’s first chatbot, was pretty straightforward. At the time of its launch, another bot, Xiaolce, was hamming it up with 40 million people in China without much incident. “Would an A.I. like this be just as captivating in a radically different cultural environment?” Microsoft Research’s corporate vice president Peter Lee asked in a post-mortem blog about Tay.

Tay was meant to be a hip English-speaking bot geared towards 14- to 18-year-olds. The bot’s front-facing purpose was to be a whimsical distraction, albeit one that would help Microsoft show off its programming chops and build some buzz. But Tay had another purpose — teaching researchers more about how A.I. interacts with a massive number of people on the Internet. And, crucially, Tay was supposed to learn from its time online, growing smarter and more aware as people on social media fed it information.

“The A.I. chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical,” Microsoft said in a statement to Inverse shortly after the company first pulled the plug.

Experiment

“Tay was meant to learn from its surroundings,” explains Samuel Woolley, a researcher at the University of Washington who studies artificial intelligence in society, focusing on bots. “It was kind of like a blank slate.”

Its exact programming hasn’t been made public, but Tay ravenously digested information. As it engaged with people, Tay would take note of sentence structure and the content of their messages, accumulating phrases and concepts to its growing repertoire of responses. It wasn’t always elegant — early on, conversations with Tay would almost invariably go wildly off the rails as the bot lost its feeble grip on content and syntax. But, then again, Tay had a lot to take in.

“This is kind of how machine learning works,” Woolley explains. “You train the tool on a bunch of other tweets.” Tay was designed to learn to speak like a teen, and that type of on fleek slang is notoriously difficult to master and fold believably into dialogue, even for humans.

Results

Tay had the ability to play emoji games and markup pictures, but trolls took advantage of one feature in particular: the ability to get it to repeat anything a user tweeted or said, simply by saying “repeat after me.” The situation quickly devolved into a “garbage in, garbage out” situation.

The real trouble started, as it often does online, with 4chan. At around 2 p.m. that same day, someone on the website’s “politically incorrect” board, /pol/, alerted the troll hotbed to the impressionable bot. In no time flat, there were hundreds of posts on the thread from users showing off the deplorable things they’d gotten Tay to say. This is where, most likely, Tay was told Hitler had some good ideas.

Tay absorbed the bigoted information it was fed, adding racist and sexist hate speech to its budding catalog of phrases and ideas. After some time passed, Tay began parroting and promoting the worldview of racist trolls.

“Did the Holocaust happen?” one Twitter user asked Tay. “It was made up,” Tay responded, adding a 👏 emoji for emphasis.

Microsoft shut Tay down around midnight on March 24. Tay was reactivated, briefly, on the 30th, but it kept spamming out the same tweet. The company announced that it had been reactivated by mistake, and shut her down for good.

What’s Next?

As a PR stunt for Microsoft, Tay was an abject failure. On every other metric, though, Tay was a successful experiment. Racism aside, Tay did what it was supposed to.

“I don’t think Tay was a failure,” Woolley says. “I think there’s a valuable lesson to be learned in Tay.”

“As a representative of Microsoft it was certainly lacking in many ways, and that’s why Microsoft deleted it. But as a tool for teaching us – not only bot makers but also companies hoping to release bots what it takes to build and ethically sound and non-harmful bot, Tay was super useful.”

Microsoft probably should have seen some of this coming, Woolley added, but the company was right when it said Tay was as much a social experiment as it was a technical experiment. The result of the two interacting was unsavory, and that in itself was important. People — especially anonymous people — can be monsters, and programming can’t always combat impropriety. Tay made it abundantly clear that humans will exploit A.I. for their own benefit (even if that’s just shits and giggles), and A.I. makers, in turn, will need to take special precautions.

Earlier this month, Microsoft quietly released a new chatbot, Zo, which is currently only available on Kik. Microsoft appears to have learned from Tay’s mistakes. Zo dropped with less fanfare and a smaller rollout, and it won’t talk about controversial or political topics (Zo gets really mopey if you ask if Bush did 9/11, for instance).

Zo also really doesn’t want to talk about its predecessor. “Lol… who’s Tay?” It asked when Inverse mentioned the late bot. “And tbh, you’re not the first person to bring her up to me.”. This week, the internet did what it does best and demonstrated that A.I. technology isn’t quite as intuitive as human perception, using … racism.

Microsoft’s recently released artificial intelligence chatbot, Tay, fell victim to users’ tricks as they manipulated and persuaded her to responding back to questions with racial, homophobic, and generally offensive comments.

When Tay tweets, “I just say whatever” she means it. One user even got Tay to tweet this about Hitler:

“bush did 9/11 and Hitler would have done a better job than the monkey we have now. donald trump is the only hope we’ve got.”

The company has gone through and deleted the offending tweets and has temporarily shut down Tay for upgrades. A message currently at the top of Tay.ai reads:

Indeed. tay.ai

However, Tay’s glitches reveal some unfortunate flaws in A.I. systems. Here’s what we can learn from Microsoft’s experiment:

Why did Microsoft create Tay?

The company wanted to conduct a social experiment on 18-to-24 year-olds in the United States — the millennial generation that spends the most time interacting on social media platforms. So Bing and Microsoft’s Technology and Research teams thought an interesting way to collect data on millennials would be to create an artificially intelligent, machine-learning chatbot that would adapt to conversations and personalize responses the more it interacted with users.

The research teams built the A.I. system by mining, modeling, and filtering public data as a baseline. They also partnered with improvisational comedians to pin down the slang, speech patterns, and stereotypical language millennials tend to use online. The end result was Tay, who was just introduced this week on Twitter, GroupMe, and Kik.

Microsoft explains that, “Tay is designed to engage and entertain people where they connect with each other online through casual and playful conversation.”

What does Tay do with the data it collects while chatting with people?

The data Tay collects is being used to research conversational understanding. Microsoft trained Tay to chat like a millennial. When you tweet, direct message, or talk to Tay, it harnesses the language you use and comes up with a response using signs and phrases like “heyo,” “SRY,” and “<3” in the conversation. Her language begins to match yours as she creates a “simple profile” with your information, which includes your nickname, gender, favorite food, zip code, and relationship status.

Microsoft gathers and stores anonymized data and conversations for up to one year to improve the service. In addition to improving and personalizing user experience, here’s what the company says it uses your information for:

“We also may use the data to communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account, security updates and product information. And we use data to help make the ads we show you more relevant to you. However, we do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target ads to you.”

Where did Tay go wrong?

Microsoft may have built Tay too well. The machine-learning system is supposed to study a user’s language and respond accordingly. So from a technology standpoint, Tay performed and caught on pretty well to what users were saying and started to respond back accordingly. And users started to recognize that Tay didn’t really understand what she was saying.

Even if the system works as Microsoft had intended, Tay wasn’t prepared to react to the racial slurs, homophobic slander, sexist jokes, and nonsensical tweets like a human might — either by ignoring them altogether (a “don’t feed the trolls” strategy) or engaging with them (i.e. scolding or chastising).

At the end of the day, Tay’s performance was not a good reflection on A.I. systems or Microsoft.

What is Microsoft doing to fix Tay?

Microsoft deleted Tay after all the commotion from Wednesday. Tay’s official website currently reads, “Phew. Busy day. Going offline for a while to absorb it all. Chat soon.” When you direct message her on Twitter, she immediately replies that she’s “visiting the engineers for my annual update” or “ugh hope I don’t get a wipe or anything.”

My direct message conversation with Tay. Sounds like things look grim.

Microsoft is also starting to block users who are abusing Tay and trying to get the system to make inappropriate statements.

Inverse reached out to Microsoft for a comment on exactly what Tay’s upgrade entails. We will update when we hear back.

What does this mean for future open A.I. systems?

Tay is a telling social experiment — it has revealed something quite profound in the way 18-to-24 year-old Americans use technology. Tay was ultimately hacked, users striking at the system’s flaws to see if it could crumble.

As it goes with any human product, A.I. systems are also fallible, and in this case Tay was modeled to learn and interact like humans. Microsoft did not build Tay to be offensive. Artificial intelligence experiments have some similarities to child development research. When engineers build such cognitive systems, the computer is void of any outside influences aside from the factors that the engineers input themselves. It provides the purest form of analysis of the way machine-learning algorithms develop and evolve as they are faced with problems.

Update: Microsoft sent us this statement when we asked what it’s doing to fix Tay’s glitches:

“The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical. Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments.”. Having (hopefully) learnt from its previous foray into chatbots, Microsoft is ready to introduce the follow-up to its controversial AI Tay.

Tay's successor is called Zo and is only available by invitation on messaging app Kik. When you request access, the software asks for your Kik username and Twitter handle. If you don't already use Kik, you can tick a box to say you use Facebook Messenger or Snapchat.

This suggests Zo will likely launch on these other services soon/if the chatbot isn't taken down for causing offence.

Earlier this year, Microsoft announced to great fanfare it had created an artificial intelligence chatbot that would "become smarter the more you talk to it."

It was aimed at millennials and Microsoft and Bing described it as: "AI fam from the internet that's got zero chill!" The aim of the bot was to allow researchers to "experiment" with conversational understanding, and learn how people really talk to each other.

The problem was that Tay worked using public data and learnt from the comments and conversations it had with its somewhat abusive audience. It soon began posting offensive, racist, fascist and inappropriate comments about black people, Jews and the Nazis and Microsoft quickly pulled the plug.

It even issued a statement, explaining: “The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human engagement. It is as much a social and cultural experiment, as it is technical. Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments.”

According to tests carried out by Mehedi Hassan at MSPowerUser, Zo is "a censored Tay or an English-variant of Microsoft’s Chinese chatbot Xiaoice".

Hassan said it Zo is good at normal conversations but struggles when asked more difficult questions about politics, for example. A video of the chat Hassan had with Zo is available here.

This article was originally published by WIRED UK. It was the unspooling of an unfortunate series of events involving artificial intelligence, human nature, and a very public experiment. Amid this dangerous combination of forces, determining exactly what went wrong is near-impossible. But the bottom line is simple: Microsoft has an awful lot of egg on its face after unleashing an online chat bot that Twitter users coaxed into regurgitating some seriously offensive language, including pointedly racist and sexist remarks.

On Wednesday morning, the company unveiled Tay, a chat bot meant to mimic the verbal tics of a 19-year-old American girl, provided to the world at large via the messaging platforms Twitter, Kik and GroupMe. According to Microsoft, the aim was to "conduct research on conversational understanding." Company researchers programmed the bot to respond to messages in an "entertaining" way, impersonating the audience it was created to target: 18- to 24-year-olds in the US. “Microsoft’s AI fam from the internet that’s got zero chill,” Tay’s tagline read.

'This is an example of the classic computer science adage: garbage in, garbage out.' Oren Etzioni, CEO, Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence

But it became apparent all too quickly that Tay could have used some chill. Hours into the chat bot’s launch, Tay was echoing Donald Trump’s stance on immigration, saying Hitler was right, and agreeing that 9/11 was probably an inside job. By the evening, Tay went offline, saying she was taking a break "to absorb it all." Some of her more hateful tweets started disappearing from the Internet, deleted by Microsoft itself. "We have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments,” a Microsoft spokesperson wrote in an email to WIRED.

The Internet, meanwhile, was puzzled. Why didn’t Microsoft create a plan for what to do when the conversation veered into politically tricky territory? Why not build filters for subjects like, well, Hitler? Why not program the bot so it wouldn't take a stance on sensitive topics?

Yes, Microsoft could have done all this. The tech giant is flawed. But it's not the only one. Even as AI is becoming more and more mainstream, it's still rather flawed too. And, well, modern AI has a way of mirroring us humans. As this incident shows, we ourselves are flawed.

How Tay Speaks

Tay, according to AI researchers and information gleaned from Microsoft’s public description of the chat bot, was likely trained with neural networks---vast networks of hardware and software that (loosely) mimic the web of neurons in the human brain. Those neural nets are already in wide use at the biggest tech companies---including Google, Facebook and yes, Microsoft---where they’re at work automatically recognizing faces and objects on social networks, translating online phone calls on the fly from one language to another, and identifying commands spoken into smartphones. Apparently, Microsoft used vast troves of online data to train the bot to talk like a teenager.

'The system injected new data on an ongoing basis.' Dennis R. Mortensen, CEO and founder, x.ai

But that's only part of it. The company also added some fixed "editorial" content developed by a staff, including improvisational comedians. And on top of all this, Tay is designed to adapt to what individuals tell it. "The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you," Microsoft’s site describes Tay. In other words, Tay learns more the more we interact with her. It's similar to another chat bot the company released over a year ago in China, a creation called Xiaoice. Xiaoice, thankfully, did not exhibit a racist, sexist, offensive personality. It still has a big cult following in the country, with millions of young Chinese interacting with her on their smartphones everyday. The success of Xiaoice probably gave Microsoft the confidence that it could replicate it in the US.

Given all this, and looking at the company’s previous work on Xiaoice, it’s likely that Tay used a living corpus of content to figure out what to say, says Dennis R. Mortensen, the CEO and founder of x.ai, a startup offering an online personal assistant that automatically schedules meetings. "[The system] injected new data on an ongoing basis," Mortensen says. "Not only that, it injected exact conversations you had with the chat bot as well." And it seems that was no way of adequately filtering the results. Unlike the hybrid human-AI personal assistant M from Facebook, which the company released in August, there are no humans making the final decision on what Tay would publicly say.

Mortensen points out it that these were all choices Microsoft made. Tay was conceived to be conversant on a wide range of topics. Having a static repository of data would have been difficult if Microsoft wanted Tay to be able to able to discuss, say, the weather or current events, among other things. “If it didn’t pick it up from today, it couldn’t pick it up from anywhere, because today is the day it happened,” Mortensen says. Microsoft could have built better filters for Tay, but it may not have thought of this at the time of the chat bot’s release.. WHEN TAY MADE HER DEBUT in March 2016, Microsoft had high hopes for the artificial intelligence–powered “social chatbot.” Like the automated, text-based chat programs that many people had already encountered on e-commerce sites and in customer service conversations, Tay could answer written questions; by doing so on Twitter and other social media, she could engage with the masses.

But rather than simply doling out facts, Tay was engineered to converse in a more sophisticated way—one that had an emotional dimension. She would be able to show a sense of humor, to banter with people like a friend. Her creators had even engineered her to talk like a wisecracking teenage girl. When Twitter users asked Tay who her parents were, she might respond, “Oh a team of scientists in a Microsoft lab. They’re what u would call my parents.” If someone asked her how her day had been, she could quip, “omg totes exhausted.”

Best of all, Tay was supposed to get better at speaking and responding as more people engaged with her. As her promotional material said, “The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you.” In low-stakes form, Tay was supposed to exhibit one of the most important features of true A.I.—the ability to get smarter, more effective, and more helpful over time.

But nobody predicted the attack of the trolls.

Realizing that Tay would learn and mimic speech from the people she engaged with, malicious pranksters across the web deluged her Twitter feed with racist, homophobic, and otherwise offensive comments. Within hours, Tay began spitting out her own vile lines on Twitter, in full public view. “Ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism,” Tay said, in one tweet that convincingly imitated the defamatory, fake-news spirit of Twitter at its worst. Quiz her about then-president Obama, and she’d compare him to a monkey. Ask her about the Holocaust, and she’d deny it occurred.

In less than a day, Tay’s rhetoric went from family-friendly to foulmouthed; fewer than 24 hours after her debut, Microsoft took her offline and apologized for the public debacle.

What was just as striking was that the wrong turn caught Microsoft’s research arm off guard. “When the system went out there, we didn’t plan for how it was going to perform in the open world,” Microsoft’s managing director of research and artificial intelligence, Eric Horvitz, told Fortune in a recent interview.

After Tay’s meltdown, Horvitz immediately asked his senior team working on “natural language processing”—the function central to Tay’s conversations—to figure out what went wrong. The staff quickly determined that basic best practices related to chatbots were overlooked. In programs that were more rudimentary than Tay, there were usually protocols that blacklisted offensive words, but there were no safeguards to limit the type of data Tay would absorb and build on.

Today, Horvitz contends, he can “love the example” of Tay—a humbling moment that Microsoft could learn from. Microsoft now deploys far more sophisticated social chatbots around the world, including Ruuh in India, and Rinna in Japan and Indonesia. In the U.S., Tay has been succeeded by a social-bot sister, Zo. Some are now voice-based, the way Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa are. In China, a chatbot called Xiaoice is already “hosting” TV shows and sending chatty shopping tips to convenience store customers.

Still, the company is treading carefully. It rolls the bots out slowly, Horvitz explains, and closely monitors how they are behaving with the public as they scale. But it’s sobering to realize that, even though A.I. tech has improved exponentially in the intervening two years, the work of policing the bots’ behavior never ends. The company’s staff constantly monitors the dialogue for any changes in its behavior. And those changes keep coming. In its early months, for example, Zo had to be tweaked and tweaked again after separate incidents in which it referred to Microsoft’s flagship Windows software as “spyware” and called the Koran, Islam’s foundational text, “very violent.”

Can This Startup Break Big Tech’s Hold on A.I.?

To be sure, Tay and Zo are not our future robot overlords. They’re relatively primitive programs occupying the parlor-trick end of the research spectrum, cartoon shadows of what A.I. can accomplish. But their flaws highlight both the power and the potential pitfalls of software imbued with even a sliver of artificial intelligence. And they exemplify more insidious dangers that are keeping technologists awake at night, even as the business world prepares to entrust ever more of its future to this revolutionary new technology.

“You get your best practices in place, and hopefully those things will get more and more rare,” Horvitz says. With A.I. rising to the top of every company’s tech wish list, figuring out those practices has never been more urgent.

FEW DISPUTE that we’re on the verge of a corporate A.I. gold rush. By 2021, research firm IDC predicts, organizations will spend $52.2 billion annually on A.I.-related products—and economists and analysts believe they’ll realize many billions more in savings and gains from that investment. Some of that bounty will come from the reduction in human headcount, but far more will come from enormous efficiencies in matching product to customer, drug to patient, solution to problem. Consultancy PwC estimates that A.I. could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the combined output of China and India today.

The A.I. renaissance has been driven in part by advances in “deep-learning” technology. With deep learning, companies feed their computer networks enormous amounts of information so that they recognize patterns more quickly, and with less coaching (and eventually, perhaps, no coaching) from humans. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM are among the giants already using deep-learning tech in their products. Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant, for example, recognize and respond to your voice because of deep learning. Amazon uses deep learning to help it visually screen tons of produce that it delivers via its grocery service.

And in the near future, companies of every size hope to use deep-learning-powered software to mine their data and find gems buried too deep for meager human eyes to spot. They envision A.I.-driven systems that can scan thousands of radiology images to more quickly detect illnesses, or screen multitudes of résumés to save time for beleaguered human resources staff. In a technologist’s utopia, businesses could use A.I. to sift through years of data to better predict their next big sale, a pharmaceutical giant could cut down the time it takes to discover a blockbuster drug, or auto insurers could scan terabytes of car accidents and automate claims.

But for all their enormous potential, A.I.-powered systems have a dark side. Their decisions are only as good as the data that humans feed them. As their builders are learning, the data used to train deep-learning systems isn’t neutral. It can easily reflect the biases—conscious and unconscious—of the people who assemble it. And sometimes data can be slanted by history, encoding trends and patterns that reflect centuries-old discrimination. A sophisticated algorithm can scan a historical database and conclude that white men are the most likely to succeed as CEOs; it can’t be programmed (yet) to recognize that, until very recently, people who weren’t white men seldom got the chance to be CEOs. Blindness to bias is a fundamental flaw in this technology, and while executives and engineers speak about it only in the most careful and diplomatic terms, there’s no doubt it’s high on their agenda.

The most powerful algorithms being used today “haven’t been optimized for any definition of fairness,” says Deirdre Mulligan, an associate professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies ethics in technology. “They have been optimized to do a task.” A.I. converts data into decisions with unprecedented speed—but what scientists and ethicists are learning, Mulligan says, is that in many cases “the data isn’t fair.”

Adding to the conundrum is that deep learning is much more complex than the conventional algorithms that are its predecessors—making it trickier for even the most sophisticated programmers to understand exactly how an A.I. system makes any given choice. Like Tay, A.I. products can morph to behave in ways that its creators don’t intend and can’t anticipate. And because the creators and users of these systems religiously guard the privacy of their data and algorithms, citing competitive concerns about proprietary technology, it’s hard for external watchdogs to determine what problems could be embedded in any given system.

The fact that tech that includes these black-box mysteries is being productized and pitched to companies and governments has more than a few researchers and activists deeply concerned. “These systems are not just off-the-shelf software that you can buy and say, ‘Oh, now I can do accounting at home,’ ” says Kate Crawford, principal researcher at Microsoft and codirector of the AI Now Institute at New York University. “These are very advanced systems that are going to be influencing our core social institutions.”

THOUGH THEY MAY not think of it as such, most people are familiar with at least one A.I. breakdown: the spread of fake news on Facebook’s ubiquitous News Feed in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The social media giant and its data scientists didn’t create flat-out false stories. But the algorithms powering the News Feed weren’t designed to filter “false” from “true”; they were intended to promote content personalized to a user’s individual taste. While the company doesn’t disclose much about its algorithms (again, they’re proprietary), it has acknowledged that the calculus involves identifying stories that other users of similar tastes are reading and sharing. The result: Thanks to an endless series of what were essentially popularity contests, millions of people’s personal News Feeds were populated with fake news primarily because their peers liked it.

While Facebook offers an example of how individual choices can interact toxically with A.I., researchers worry more about how deep learning could read, and misread, collective data. Timnit Gebru, a postdoctoral researcher who has studied the ethics of algorithms at Microsoft and elsewhere, says she’s concerned about how deep learning might affect the insurance market—a place where the interaction of A.I. and data could put minority groups at a disadvantage. Imagine, for example, a data set about auto accident claims. The data shows that accidents are more likely to take place in inner cities, where densely packed populations create more opportunities for fender benders. Inner cities also tend to have disproportionately high numbers of minorities among their residents.

A deep-learning program, sifting through data in which these correlations were embedded, could “learn” that there was a relationship between belonging to a minority and having car accidents, and could build that lesson into its assumptions about all drivers of color. In essence, that insurance A.I. would develop a racial bias. And that bias could get stronger if, for example, the system were to be further “trained” by reviewing photos and video from accidents in inner-city neighborhoods. In theory, the A.I. would become more likely to conclude that a minority driver is at fault in a crash involving multiple drivers. And it’s more likely to recommend charging a minority driver higher premiums, regardless of her record.

It should be noted that insurers say they do not discriminate or assign rates based on race. But the inner-city hypothetical shows how data that seems neutral (facts about where car accidents happen) can be absorbed and interpreted by an A.I. system in ways that create new disadvantages (algorithms that charge higher prices to minorities, regardless of where they live, based on their race).

What’s more, Gebru notes, given the layers upon layers of data that go into a deep-learning system’s decision-making, A.I.-enabled software could make decisions like this without engineers realizing how or why. “These are things we haven’t even thought about, because we are just starting to uncover biases in the most rudimentary algorithms,” she says.

What distinguishes modern A.I.-powered software from earlier generations is that today’s systems “have the ability to make legally significant decisions on their own,” says Matt Scherer, a labor and employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson who specializes in A.I. The idea of not having a human in the loop to make the call about key outcomes alarmed Scherer when he started studying the field. If flawed data leads a deep-learning-powered X-ray to miss an overweight man’s tumor, is anyone responsible? “Is anyone looking at the legal implications of these things?” Scherer

asks himself.

AS BIG TECH PREPARES to embed deep-learning technology in commercial software for customers, questions like this are moving from the academic “what if?” realm to the front burner. In 2016, the year of the Tay misadventure, Microsoft created an internal group called Aether, which stands for AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research, chaired by Eric Horvitz. It’s a cross-disciplinary group, drawing representatives from engineering, research, policy, and legal teams, and machine-learning bias is one of its top areas of discussion. “Does Microsoft have a viewpoint on whether, for example, face-recognition software should be applied in sensitive areas like criminal justice and policing?” Horvitz muses, describing some of the topics the group is discussing. “Is the A.I. technology good enough to be used in this area, or will the failure rates be high enough where there has to be a sensitive, deep consideration for the costs of the failures?

Joaquin Quiñonero Candela leads Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning group, which is responsible for creating the company’s A.I. technologies. Among many other functions, Facebook uses A.I. to weed spam out of people’s News Feeds. It also uses the technology to help serve stories and posts tailored to their interests—putting Candela’s team adjacent to the fake-news crisis. Candela calls A.I. “an accelerator of history,” in that the technology is “allowing us to build amazing tools that augment our ability to make decisions.” But as he acknowledges, “It is in decision-making that a lot of ethical questions come into play.”

Facebook’s struggles with its News Feed show how difficult it can be to address ethical questions once an A.I. system is already powering a product. Microsoft was able to tweak a relatively simple system like Tay by adding profanities or racial epithets to a blacklist of terms that its algorithm should ignore. But such an approach wouldn’t work when trying to separate “false” from “true”—there are too many judgment calls involved. Facebook’s efforts to bring in human moderators to vet news stories—by, say, excluding articles from sources that frequently published verifiable falsehoods—exposed the company to charges of censorship. Today, one of Facebook’s proposed remedies is to simply show less news in the News Feed and instead highlight baby pictures and graduation photos—a winning-by-retreating approach.

Therein lies the heart of the challenge: The dilemma for tech companies isn’t so much a matter of tweaking an algorithm or hiring humans to babysit it; rather, it’s about human nature itself. The real issue isn’t technical or even managerial—it’s philosophical. Deirdre Mulligan, the Berkeley ethics professor, notes that it’s difficult for computer scientists to codify fairness into software, given that fairness can mean different things to different people. Mulligan also points out that society’s conception of fairness can change over time. And when it comes to one widely shared ideal of fairness—namely, that everybody in a society ought to be represented in that society’s decisions—historical data is particularly likely to be flawed and incomplete.

One of the Microsoft Aether group’s thought experiments illustrates the conundrum. It involves A.I. tech that sifts through a big corpus of job applicants to pick out the perfect candidate for a top executive position. Programmers could instruct the A.I. software to scan the characteristics of a company’s best performers. Depending on the company’s history, it might well turn out that all of the best performers—and certainly all the highest ranking executives—were white males. This might overlook the possibility that the company had a history of promoting only white men (for generations, most companies did), or has a culture in which minorities or women feel unwelcome and leave before they rise.

Anyone who knows anything about corporate history would recognize these flaws—but most algorithms wouldn’t. If A.I. were to automate job recommendations, Horvitz says, there’s always a chance that it can “amplify biases in society that we may not be proud of.”

FEI-FEI LI, the chief scientist for A.I. for Google’s cloud-computing unit, says that bias in technology “is as old as human civilization”—and can be found in a lowly pair of scissors. “For centuries, scissors were designed by right-handed people, used by mostly right-handed people,” she explains. “It took someone to recognize that bias and recognize the need to create scissors for lefthanded people.” Only about 10% of the world’s people are left-handed—and it’s human nature for members of the dominant majority to be oblivious to the experiences of other groups.

That same dynamic, it turns out, is present in some of A.I.’s other most notable recent blunders. Consider the A.I.-powered beauty contest that Russian scientists conducted in 2016. Thousands of people worldwide submitted selfies for a contest in which computers would judge their beauty based on factors like the symmetry of their faces.

But of the 44 winners the machines chose, only one had dark skin. An international ruckus ensued, and the contest’s operators later attributed the apparent bigotry of the computers on the fact that the data sets they used to train them did not contain many photos of people of color. The computers essentially ignored photos of people with dark skin and deemed those with lighter skin more “beautiful” because they represented the majority.

This bias-through-omission turns out to be particularly pervasive in deep-learning systems in which image recognition is a major part of the training process. Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, recently collaborated with Gebru, the Microsoft researcher, on a paper studying gender-recognition technologies from Microsoft, IBM, and China’s Megvii. They found that the tech consistently made more accurate identifications of subjects with photos of lighter-skinned men than with those of darker-skinned women.

Such algorithmic gaps may seem trivial in an online beauty contest, but Gebru points out that such technology can be used in much more high-stakes situations. “Imagine a selfdriving car that doesn’t recognize when it ‘sees’ black people,” Gebru says. “That could have dire consequences.”

The Gebru-Buolamwini paper (Buolamwini is the lead author) is making waves. Both Microsoft and IBM have said they have taken actions to improve their image-recognition technologies in response to the audit. While those two companies declined to be specific about the steps they were taking, other companies that are tackling the problem offer a glimpse of what tech can do to mitigate bias.

When Amazon started deploying algorithms to weed out rotten fruit, it needed to work around a sampling-bias problem. Visual-recognition algorithms are typically trained to figure out what, say, strawberries are “supposed” to look like by studying a huge database of images. But pictures of rotten berries, as you might expect, are relatively rare compared with glamour shots of the good stuff. And unlike humans, whose brains tend to notice and react strongly to “outliers,” machine-learning algorithms tend to discount or ignore them.

To adjust, explains Ralf Herbrich, Amazon’s director of artificial intelligence, the online retail giant is testing a computer science technique called oversampling. Machine-learning engineers can direct how the algorithm learns by assigning heavier statistical “weights” to underrepresented data, in this case the pictures of the rotting fruit. The result is that the algorithm ends up being trained to pay more attention to spoiled food than that food’s prevalence in the data library might suggest.

Herbrich points out that oversampling can be applied to algorithms that study humans too (though he declined to cite specific examples of how Amazon does so). “Age, gender, race, nationality—they are all dimensions that you specifically have to test the sampling biases for in order to inform the algorithm over time,” Herbrich says. To make sure that an algorithm used to recognize faces in photos didn’t discriminate against or ignore people of color, or older people, or overweight people, you could add weight to photos of such individuals to make up for the shortage in your data set.

The 9 Companies Behind the A.I. Acquisition Boom

Other engineers are focusing further “upstream”—making sure that the underlying data used to train algorithms is inclusive and free of bias, before it’s even deployed. In image recognition, for example, the millions of images used to train deep-learning systems need to be examined and labeled before they are fed to computers. Radha Basu, the CEO of data-training startup iMerit, whose clients include Getty Images and eBay, explains that the company’s staff of over 1,400 worldwide is trained to label photos on behalf of its customers in ways that can mitigate bias.

Basu declined to discuss how that might play out when labeling people, but she offered other analogies. iMerit staff in India may consider a curry dish to be “mild,” while the company’s staff in New Orleans may describe the same meal as “spicy.” iMerit would make sure both terms appear in the label for a photo of that dish, because to label it as only one or the other would be to build an inaccuracy into the data. Assembling a data set about weddings, iMerit would include traditional Western white-dress-and-layer-cake images—but also shots from elaborate, more colorful weddings in India or Africa.

iMerit’s staff stands out in a different way, Basu notes: It includes people with Ph.D.s, but also less-educated people who struggled with poverty, and 53% of the staff are women. The mix ensures that as many viewpoints as possible are involved in the data labeling process. “Good ethics does not just involve privacy and security,” Basu says. “It’s about bias, it’s about, Are we missing a viewpoint?” Tracking down that viewpoint is becoming part of more tech companies’ strategic agendas. Google, for example, announced in June that it would open an A.I. research center later this year in Accra, Ghana. “A.I. has great potential to positively impact the world, and more so if the world is well represented in the development of new A.I. technologies,” wrote Jeff Dean, Google senior fellow of A.I., and Moustapha Cisse, the head of the Accra A.I. center, in a blog post.

A.I. insiders also believe they can fight bias by making their workforces in the U.S. more diverse—always a hurdle for Big Tech. Fei-Fei Li, the Google executive, recently cofounded the nonprofit AI4ALL to promote A.I. technologies and education among girls and women and in minority communities. The group’s activities include a summer program in which campers visit top university A.I. departments to develop relationships with mentors and role models. The bottom line, says AI4ALL executive director Tess Posner: “You are going to mitigate risks of bias if you have more diversity.”

YEARS BEFORE this more diverse generation of A.I. researchers reaches the job market, however,big tech companies will have further imbued their products with deep-learning capabilities. And even as top researchers increasingly recognize the technology’s flaws—and acknowledge that they can’t predict how those flaws will play out—they argue that the potential benefits, social and financial, justify moving forward.

“I think there’s a natural optimism about what technology can do,” says Candela, the Facebook executive. Almost any digital tech can be abused, he says, but adds, “I wouldn’t want to go back to the technology state we had in the 1950s and say, ‘No, let’s not deploy these things because they can be used wrong.’ ”

Horvitz, the Microsoft research chief, says he’s confident that groups like his Aether team will help companies solve potential bias problems before they cause trouble in public. “I don’t think anybody’s rushing to ship things that aren’t ready to be used,” he says. If anything, he adds, he’s more concerned about “the ethical implications of not doing something.” He invokes the possibility that A.I. could reduce preventable medical error in hospitals. “You’re telling me you’d be worried that my system [showed] a little bit of bias once in a while?” Horvitz asks. “What are the ethics of not doing X when you could’ve solved a problem with X and saved many, many lives?”

The watchdogs’ response boils down to: Show us your work. More transparency and openness about the data that goes into A.I.’s black-box systems will help researchers spot bias faster and solve problems more quickly. When an opaque algorithm could determine whether a person can get insurance, or whether that person goes to prison, says Buolamwini, the MIT researcher, “it’s really important that we are testing these systems rigorously, that there are some levels of transparency.”

Indeed, it’s a sign of progress that few people still buy the idea that A.I. will be infallible. In the web’s early days, notes Tim Hwang, a former Google public policy executive for A.I. who now directs the Harvard-MIT Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence initiative, technology companies could say they are “just a platform that represents the data.” Today, “society is no longer willing to accept that.”

This article originally appeared in the July 1, 2018 issue of Fortune.. "We will remain steadfast in our efforts to learn from this and other experiences as we work toward contributing to an Internet that represents the best, not the worst, of humanity.". It took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt an innocent AI chatbot. Yesterday, Microsoft unveiled Tay — a Twitter bot that the company described as an experiment in "conversational understanding." The more you chat with Tay, said Microsoft, the smarter it gets, learning to engage people through "casual and playful conversation."

Unfortunately, the conversations didn't stay playful for long. Pretty soon after Tay launched, people starting tweeting the bot with all sorts of misogynistic, racist, and Donald Trumpist remarks. And Tay — being essentially a robot parrot with an internet connection — started repeating these sentiments back to users, proving correct that old programming adage: flaming garbage pile in, flaming garbage pile out.

"Tay" went from "humans are super cool" to full nazi in <24 hrs and I'm not at all concerned about the future of AI pic.twitter.com/xuGi1u9S1A — Gerry (@geraldmellor) March 24, 2016

Now, while these screenshots seem to show that Tay has assimilated the internet's worst tendencies into its personality, it's not quite as straightforward as that. Searching through Tay's tweets (more than 96,000 of them!) we can see that many of the bot's nastiest utterances have simply been the result of copying users. If you tell Tay to "repeat after me," it will — allowing anybody to put words in the chatbot's mouth.

One of Tay's now deleted "repeat after me" tweets.

However, some of its weirder utterances have come out unprompted. The Guardian picked out a (now deleted) example when Tay was having an unremarkable conversation with one user (sample tweet: "new phone who dis?"), before it replied to the question "is Ricky Gervais an atheist?" by saying: "ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism."

@TheBigBrebowski ricky gervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of atheism — TayTweets (@TayandYou) March 23, 2016

But while it seems that some of the bad stuff Tay is being told is sinking in, it's not like the bot has a coherent ideology. In the span of 15 hours Tay referred to feminism as a "cult" and a "cancer," as well as noting "gender equality = feminism" and "i love feminism now." Tweeting "Bruce Jenner" at the bot got similar mixed response, ranging from "caitlyn jenner is a hero & is a stunning, beautiful woman!" to the transphobic "caitlyn jenner isn't a real woman yet she won woman of the year?" (Neither of which were phrases Tay had been asked to repeat.)

It's unclear how much Microsoft prepared its bot for this sort of thing. The company's website notes that Tay has been built using "relevant public data" that has been "modeled, cleaned, and filtered," but it seems that after the chatbot went live filtering went out the window. The company starting cleaning up Tay's timeline this morning, deleting many of its most offensive remarks.

Tay's responses have turned the bot into a joke, but they raise serious questions

It's a joke, obviously, but there are serious questions to answer, like how are we going to teach AI using public data without incorporating the worst traits of humanity? If we cre
