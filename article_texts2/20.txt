Tesla is taking PR very seriously after one of its vehicles in autonomous mode killed a passenger recently.

The crash occurred at 9:27 AM on Highway 101 near Mountain View, California. Walter Huang was in the driver's seat of the Model X, which was in autonomous mode. The car hit a concrete highway divider, marked with black and yellow chevrons, at full force. Huang didn't take any action. The SUV crumpled like a tin can, and Huang didn't make it.

Other information has been hard to come by, due to the severity of the damage. So far we don't know if his death was a result of negligence, a fatal nap, or simply being distracted by the fireworks of warning lights, and sounds. But one thing is clear: the crash proves that audio and visual cues on the dashboard could after all be insufficient to prevent a crash.

Huang wasn't the first to die in a Tesla with Autopilot active. In 2016, Joshua Brown crashed his Model S into a truck, marking the first fatal collision while Autopilot was engaged.

The timing for this particular crash isn't exactly ideal (from Tesla's perspective). Uber is already doing damage control after its self-driving car killed a pedestrian in Arizona on March 19, four days before Huang's fatal collision.

Interestingly, officials aren't too pleased about Tesla's PR offensive. On Sunday, a spokesperson for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) told the Washington Post:

At this time the NTSB needs the assistance of Tesla to decode the data the vehicle recorded. In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data. However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.

Presumably, investigators aren't happy because they'd like to get as much information as they can, then release a report.

But Tesla might have jumped the gun. Not complying with the NTSB's investigation processes and deadlines might end up having their technological advancements (and security improvements) screech to a halt.

After the Uber car's crash, the company was banned from further testing in Arizona (though other companies were allowed to continue). Many people feared that the crash would fray the public's trust in autonomous vehicles, and that largely has not come to pass, at least not yet.

But if the crashes continue, that could change. The market for autonomous cars could dry up before the technology becomes reliable enough to make them widespread.

Tesla's Autopilot is Level 2 autonomy, while Uber's self-driving car is a Level 4. So the technology isn't even really the same. Still, a turn in the tide of public opinion could sweep both up with it.

Autonomous vehicles aren't the best at sharing the unpredictable road with imprecise humans. Yes, once fully autonomous vehicles roll out all over the country and make up 100 percent of the vehicles on the road, American roads will inevitably become safer.

But we're not there yet. If crashes like these keep happening, and the public loses trust, we might never be.

Update: Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to respond to comments from NTSB and reiterate Tesla's priorities:

Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 2, 2018. . In the fall of 2016, Tesla beamed new software over the air to cars on the road in the United States and elsewhere that added safeguards to its Autopilot system to prevent drivers from looking away from the road or keeping their hands off the steering wheel for long periods of time.

The move came in the wake of a crash in Florida in which an Ohio man died when his Model S sedan hit a tractor-trailer while Autopilot was engaged. Federal investigators found that the driver’s hands had been on the steering wheel for only a few seconds in the minute before the crash.

When the upgrades were released, Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the new Autopilot system was “really going to be beyond what people expect” and would make the Tesla Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle the safest cars on the road “by far.”

Now, however, Tesla’s semiautonomous driving system is coming under new scrutiny after the company disclosed late on Friday that a fatal crash on March 23 in California occurred while Autopilot was engaged.. Tesla confirmed that its self-driving feature, Autopilot, was engaged in a fatal accident that occurred in California. Walter Huang, the driver of the Model X, struck a compressed traffic attenuator and was killed despite having Autopilot engaged. Prior to the data being revealed, the man's family made complaints to local outlet Mercury News that he had reportedly brought his Model X to Tesla several times over complaints about the Autopilot system.

Tesla's Autopilot is far from being crowned a perfect driver. Complaints about the company's latest hardware revision, called AP2, have been made by drivers for many months, often claiming that they felt the system was not as accurate as the company's first iteration, AP1. The updated technology has often shown past difficulty of being able to avoid traveling into other lanes; however, Tesla's over-the-air firmware updates have seemingly improved upon them since the introduction of AP2.

Huang's family reportedly told local news that Huang made several complaints to his local Tesla dealer regarding the vehicle veering off the road with Autopilot engaged. What seemingly makes matters worse is that the dealer was allegedly told that it wasn't just any stretch of road Huang experienced the problem with, but the same stretch of road where the accident occurred.

A Tesla spokesperson told local news that they could find no record suggesting that Huang ever reported the Autopilot performance complaints to Tesla.

The manufacturer's investigation over the crash revealed that Huang had his hands off of the steering wheel when the accident occurred, and despite receiving warnings for over six seconds prior to the crash, no action was said to be taken by the driver. Tesla goes on to defend Autopilot by stating that it is 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident than a human driver.. SAN FRANCISCO — A Tesla Model S that crashed into a stopped fire truck at high speed was operating in Autopilot mode, the driver of the car told Utah police officials.

Tesla says it continues to work with police on the investigation, and has not yet released details of the incident based on the car's computer logs.

The driver of the vehicle, a 28-year-old woman from Lehi, Utah, slammed into the truck in South Jordan, Utah on Friday. The woman also told police she was looking at her phone prior to the collision and estimated her speed at 60 mph, which is consistent with eyewitness accounts, according to a police statement issued late Monday.

The result of the violent crash was an accordioned front end for the electric car, but only a broken foot for the driver, according to Sgt. Sam Winkler of the South Jordan Police Department.

The driver of the United Fire Authority mechanic truck was evaluated for whiplash and was not checked into the hospital.

Tesla said the company's previous response to the crash still stood, which noted that Autopilot — a semi-autonomous system that works like a souped-up cruise control — requires constant vigilance and is not meant to take over driving responsibilities while the driver focuses on other chores.

Winkler said that South Jordan police was continuing to investigate the crash, and would be working with Tesla to gather vehicle information from the Model S's computers over the coming days. Police officials also said they were getting technical assistance from National Transportation Safety Board officials.

Eyewitness accounts indicate the Model S did not slow down or swerve as it rammed into the back of the truck, which was stopped at a traffic light in the far right lane.

More:Tesla crash that killed two Florida teens probed by NTSB investigators

Autopilot has been in the crosshairs of federal crash investigators, dating back to a 2016 crash of Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode that killed its driver after the car failed to stop for a tractor trailer that cut across its path.

More recently, the NTSB was called in to review details of a March crash in which a Tesla Model X slam into a highway divider in Mountain View, Calif. The driver died.

Tesla has said the California driver ignored the car's warnings to take back control of the vehicle. But the driver's family is considering suing on the grounds that Tesla ignored the driver's previously raised concerns about Autopilot acting up on that same stretch of Silicon Valley highway.

NTSB and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials also are investigating a recent Tesla Model S crash in Florida in which two teens died and one was injured.

The car hit a concrete barrier at high speed in a residential neighborhood and burst into flames. Autopilot is not thought to be a factor, but investigators are looking into the ensuing battery fire.

Just prior to Utah police announcing that the driver indicated Autopilot had been in use, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted a series of tweets that emphasized the safety of his product.

"What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle," Musk tweeted (although initially reported as an ankle injury, South Jordan officials said the injury was a broken foot). "An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death."

Musk also lamented media coverage that he said glossed over the 40,000 annual U.S. road deaths, and acknowledged that while no technology is perfect "a system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."

Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.. ‘We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.’

Electric carmaker Tesla has confirmed its “Autopilot” feature was engaged during a fatal crash last week, a development set to exacerbate concerns over the safety of futuristic vehicles.

Autopilot is still far from a completely autonomous driving system, which would not require any involvement by a human.

Autopilot is considered part of the second of five levels of autonomous driving, with the fifth being fully autonomous – something once featured in futuristic cartoons but which has moved closer to reality.

Car crash

A Tesla Model X – the latest model – collided with a highway barrier near the town of Mountain View in California on March 23, catching fire before two other cars struck it.

The driver was identified by The Mercury News as a 38-year-old man, Wei Huang, an engineer for Apple. He later died in hospital.

Tesla issued a blog post late Friday saying the driver had activated the Autopilot but ignored several warnings.

“In the moments before the collision … Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum,” Tesla said.

“The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.

“The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters (164 yards) of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.”

Tesla added the reason the car sustained such great damage was because a highway barrier “had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced”.

“We have never seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash,” it said.

The company, founded 15 years ago by Elon Musk, sought to downplay fears over its technology.

“Over a year ago, our first iteration of Autopilot was found by the US government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40 percent,” it said.

Pedestrian killed

In January last year, the US Transportation Department closed an investigation into the fatal 2016 crash in Florida of a Tesla Model S on Autopilot, finding that no “safety-related defect” had caused that accident, the first of its kind.

The latest fatal Tesla crash came the same week a collision involving an autonomous Uber vehicle in Arizona killed a pedestrian and caused that company to temporarily halt its self-driving car programme.

Circumstances of the two crashes are different: Tesla’s Autopilot is a driver assistance feature, while the Uber vehicle was designed to operate autonomously but with a driver behind the wheel to correct mistakes.

Dashcam footage released by police showed that the operator appeared to be distracted seconds before the car hit the woman.

The nonprofit group Consumer Watchdog has argued that autonomous vehicles are not ready for roads and the public should not be put at risk to test such technology.

After the Uber accident, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said, “Autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians and drivers.”

Competition

Both Uber and Tesla are rivals in the multibillion-dollar drive to develop vehicles which, in the future, will not need any driver intervention.

Among other contenders, General Motors has asked to test a car with no steering wheel on roads beginning next year. Google-owned Waymo is also intensifying its self-driving efforts.

If the final, fifth stage, of autonomous driving is still distant, microprocessor manufacturer NVIDIA unveiled an artificial intelligence platform to enable that goal several months ago.

The system can perform 320 trillion operations a second, completely independently of a vehicle’s passengers.

California-based NVIDIA provided some technology in the Uber car which crashed in Arizona, prompting the chip firm to suspend its road tests pending more information about the incident..

For years, Tesla has boasted that its cars and SUVs are safer than other vehicles on the roads, and CEO Elon Musk doubled down on the claims in a series of tweets this week.

The electric vehicles are under intense scrutiny from federal investigators, who have been looking into post-crash battery fires and the performance of Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system. On Wednesday, they traveled to Utah to open another inquiry into a Tesla crash—their fourth this year—in which a Model S slammed into a firetruck that was stopped at a red light.

A look at the tweets and Tesla's past claims about the safety of its vehicles and Autopilot:

MUSK (from his tweets Monday): "According to (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 ((tilde)40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It's not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla."

THE FACTS: This is based on a Tesla analysis of U.S. fatal crashes per miles traveled in 2017. The company's math is correct on the fatality rate involving all of the nation's 272 million vehicles, about 150,000 of which are Teslas, according to sales estimates from Ward's Automotive. But Tesla won't say how many fatalities occurred in its vehicles or how many miles they were driven.

We don't know of any Tesla fatalities in 2017, but the numbers can vary widely from year to year. There have been at least three already this year and a check of 2016 NHTSA fatal crash data—the most recent year available—shows five deaths in Tesla vehicles.

Statistically, experts say Musk's tweet analysis isn't valid. While Teslas could have a lower death rate, it may speak more about the demographics of Tesla drivers than it does about safety of the vehicles, says Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics for the National Safety Council.

Expensive Teslas tend to be driven by middle-age affluent people who are less likely to get in a crash than younger people, Kolosh said. Also, Tesla drivers tend to live in urban areas and travel on roads with lower speeds, where fatality rates are lower, he said.

Musk also is comparing a fleet of older, less-expensive vehicles to his newer and more costly models, Kolosh said. Most Teslas on the road are six years old or less. The average vehicle in the U.S. is 11.6 years old, according to IHS Markit. Older, less-expensive vehicles often aren't maintained like newer ones and would have more mechanical problems.

MUSK (from his tweets Monday in reference to the Utah crash): "What's actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60 mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death."

THE FACTS: It's true that the driver in the Utah crash sustained minor injuries considering how fast her car was traveling. The same is true for a January freeway crash near Los Angeles in which the driver was not hurt. But not all Tesla crashes end the same way.

In March, the driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in California when his SUV hit a barrier while traveling at "freeway speed." NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating that case, in which the Autopilot system was engaged. Autopilot was also engaged in the Utah crash, according to a summary of data from the car.

Last week, the NTSB opened a probe into an accident in which a Model S caught fire after crashing into a wall at a high speed in Florida. Two 18-year-olds were trapped in the vehicle and died in the flames. The agency has said it does not expect Autopilot to be a focus of that investigation.

TESLA (from a March 30 press release): "Over a year ago, our first iteration of Autopilot was found by the U.S. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40 percent."

THE FACTS: The government says it did not assess how effective Autopilot is at reducing crashes. It did mention a 40 percent reduction in crash rates after "Autosteer" was installed in Tesla vehicles, based on data provided by Tesla. Autosteer is the part of Autopilot that keeps the car centered in a lane and can change lanes automatically. NHTSA said it did a "cursory" comparison of crash rates between vehicles with and without Autosteer, but it didn't consider whether drivers were actually using Autosteer, which has to be manually activated.

TESLA: The company has touted on its website and in press releases that the Model S sedan scored the highest numerical rating of any vehicle in NHTSA's crash tests, and that the Model X was the first SUV to get a five-star rating in every category.

THE FACTS: It's true that the Model S and Model X got five-star crash-test ratings from NHTSA, and the Model S did have the highest numerical score of any vehicle. But in more demanding tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Model S failed to get the industry group's coveted "Top Safety Pick" or "Top Safety Pick Plus" ratings.

The reasons: the Model S got an "Acceptable" rating in a front-end small offset crash test that mimics when the front driver-side corner of a vehicle collides with a tree or another vehicle. Its headlights also were rated "Poor." Vehicles have to get the highest rating of "Good" in five crash tests to be top safety picks. Fourteen large cars from other manufacturers received Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick Plus ratings. IIHS has not yet done crash tests on Tesla's Model X or Model 3.

The Model S also had a low rate of medical insurance claims for injuries, tying for seventh in IIHS's most recent rankings. The institute gave it a score of 46, which is 54 percent better than the average score of 100. The Toyota Camry, the top-selling car in America, scored 112. But the Model S had higher collision claim frequencies and was more expensive to fix than gas-powered large luxury cars.

© 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.. It’s the year 2025. Your driverless car has just crashed into a tree at 55mph because its built-in computer valued a pedestrian’s life above your own. Your injuries are the result of a few lines of code that were hacked out by a 26-year-old software programmer in the San Francisco Bay Area back in the heady days of 2018. As you wait for a paramedic drone, bleeding out by the roadside, you ask yourself – where did it all go wrong?

The above scenario might sound fanciful, but death by driverless car isn’t just inevitable – it’s already happening. Most recently, an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona, while in May 2017, semi-autonomous software failed in a similarly tragic way when Joshua Brown’s Tesla Model S drove under the trailer of an 18-wheel truck on a highway while in Autopilot mode.

Tesla admits that its system sensors failed to distinguish the white trailer against a bright sky, resulting in the untimely death of the 40-year-old Floridian. But Tesla also says that drivers need to keep their hands on the wheel to stop accidents like this from happening, even when Autopilot is activated. Despite the name, it’s a semi-autonomous system.

Uber, on the other hand, may not be at fault, according to a preliminary police report, which lays the blame on the victim.

It’s a sad fact that these tragedies are just a taste what’s to come. In writing this article, I’ve realised how woefully unprepared we are for the driverless future – expected as soon as 2020. What’s more worrying is that this future is already spilling out into our present, thanks to semi-autonomous systems like Tesla’s Autopilot and Uber’s (now halted) self-driving car tests.

Tomorrow’s technology is here today, and with issues like ethics and liability now impossible to avoid, car makers can’t afford not to be ready.

What happens when a driverless car causes an accident and, worse still, kills someone?

Understanding death by computer

To tackle liability, we need to ask how and why a driverless car could kill someone. Unlike humans, cars don’t suffer fatigue, they don’t experience road rage, and they can’t knock back six pints of beer before hitting the highway – but they can still make mistakes.

Tesla’s Model S features semi-autonomous Autopilot technology

Arguably, the most likely cause of “death-by-driverless-car” would be if a car’s sensors were to incorrectly interpret data, causing the computer to make a bad driving decision. While every incident, fatal or otherwise, will result in fixes and improvements, tracing the responsibility would be a long and arduous legal journey. I’ll get to that later.

The second possible cause of death-by-driverless-car is much more difficult to resolve, because it’s all about ethics.

Picture this scenario: You’re riding in a driverless car with your spouse, travelling along a single-lane, tree-lined B-road. There are dozens upon dozens of B-roads like this in the UK. The car is travelling at 55mph, which is below the 60mph national speed limit on this road.

A blind bend is coming up, so your car slows down to a more sensible 40mph. As you travel around the bend, you see that a child has run out onto the road from a public footpath hidden in the trees. His mother panicked and followed him, and now they’re both in the middle of the road. It’s a windy day and your car is electric, so they didn’t hear you coming. The sensors on your car didn’t see either of them until they were just metres away.

There’s no chance of braking in time, so the mother and child are going to die if your car doesn’t swerve immediately. If the car swerves to the left, you go off-road and hit a tree; if the car swerves right, you hit an autonomous truck coming in the opposite direction. It’s empty, so you and your spouse would be the only casualties.

In this situation, the car is forced to make a decision – does it hit the pedestrians, almost certainly killing them, or does it risk the passengers in the probability that they may survive the accident. The answers will have been decided months (or even years) before, when the algorithms were originally programmed into your car’s computer system – and they could very well end your life. While the car won’t know it, this is in effect an ethical decision.

To demonstrate the overwhelming difficulty of coding ethics, have a go at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Moral Machine. It’s a quiz that aims to track how humans react to moral decisions made by self-driving cars. You’re presented with a series of scenarios where a driverless car has to choose between two evils (i.e. killing two passengers or five pedestrians) and you have to choose which one you think is most acceptable. As you’ll quickly realise, it’s really hard.

Which scenario would you choose? MIT’s Moral Machine is a self-driving nightmare

If all of this scares you, you’re not alone. In March, a survey by US motoring organisation AAA revealed that three out of four US drivers are “afraid” of riding in self-driving cars, and 84% of those said that was because they trusted their own driving skills more than a computer’s, in spite of overwhelming evidence that suggests that driverless cars are significantly safer – human error is the biggest killer on our roads, after all.

So why are we so afraid? I asked Prof. Luciano Floridi, Professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the University of Oxford, that very question.

“I think it’s an ancestral fear of the unknown, fear of machines. It was the Golem and Frankenstein, and now it’s a technology that we don’t fully control in the case of driverless cars,” Professor Floridi tells me. “It also seems to be, perhaps, a mis-selling on the side of the industry, where total safety is sold as a possibility, which we know is not the case. Nothing is 100% safe, you can only be safer.”

So even though driverless cars are safer and reduce a person’s chance of death, drivers struggle to accept the idea that they could be killed by a machine, rather than by human error.

The greater good vs your safety – who wins?

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently surveyed 2,000 people and found that 76% of respondents would expect a driverless car to prioritise the safety of a group of ten pedestrians over a single passenger. Very noble, right? In ethics, this is called “utilitarianism” – that’s shorthand for when decisions are made for the greater good.

But humans are animals, and that means evolution has wired us to protect ourselves and those who are important to us, often at the expense of the “greater good”, whatever that may be.

Tellingly, when MIT’s respondents were asked to rate the morality of that same driverless car – the one that would crash and kill its owner to save the pedestrians – as if they themselves were a passenger in the vehicle, the morality rating of the “ethical” car dropped by a third.

The moral of the story is no great surprise – we all like the idea of utilitarian driverless cars, until we have to ride in one. This self-preserving belief system will have an acute effect on the driverless car industry. For instance, what if car makers start selling their vehicles on an ethical basis? Could some cars be designed to always strive for a “greatest good” result, while others are built to act in the interests of the driver or passengers?

But, while Professor Floridi believes ethics will play some part in marketing driverless vehicles, he isn’t convinced they’ll be sold based on their moral code:

“That would be such a bad move on the advertising side of things. What we will see, however, is some ethical component in advertising at large. If you remember when cars started being advertised as safer because of safety belts, companies saying it was so much safer if you’re in an accident. It will be like that. Not that this ethical code is better than that ethical code.”

Professor Luciano Floridi thinks ethics is one of the biggest roadblocks to the driverless car future

Are driverless cars impossibly complicated?

Unfortunately for us all, Floridi tells me, driverless cars are ill-equipped to tackle such complex decisions. He believes that despite all of the research and development efforts focused on bringing driverless cars onto our roads, computers are inherently unable to handle the complex moral decisions that driving demands.

“The ethics is delicate, too subtle, too open-ended for an ordinary driverless car,” he explains. “The car I need to go from the countryside to London, or from London back to Rome, as I did when I was a young guy with not much money – can you imagine that journey? Around 2,000 miles from Oxford to Rome and back? In a context where anything could happen, it’s very hard to imagine a totally uncontrolled environment with a driverless car being successful, without me having a chance to pick up the wheel.”

Floridi says that it’s “impossible” to create an algorithm that can emulate human ethics on the road, because there are an infinite number of possible scenarios that can arise when driving. He gives the example of a cat in the road:

“You could say ‘stop every time’ there’s a cat – unless what? Unless there’s a big truck driving at 70mph behind you, and you have your kids in the car. At that point you say ‘go and kill the cat’, because your family is at risk. You can multiply this with ‘only if’ and ‘unless’ to an endless number of conditions.”

Why is it so difficult? Well, it’s very easy to computerise a closed world, where we can understand every single condition. But driving is an open-world scenario, where the conditions are random and impossible to predict, which makes it very hard to computerise. It’s because of this that Floridi believes there’s no hope for driverless car software to be sufficiently ethically competent, at least on existing road networks:

“Imagine playing chess with someone who picks up a gun at some point, out of his pocket, and says ‘you can’t make that move,’” jokes Floridi. “That’s a different kind of chess. No computer can do anything about it, no matter what we’ve put into it.”

Floridi says that to tackle this, car companies are already consulting with ethics experts to make sure their software is morally watertight. I asked for an example, and he told me that he attended a meeting with Audi “where ethical issues were the main topic precisely because of the implications of driverless cars. As any advanced technology that we develop requires, at some point the social impact forces an ethical consideration.”

So who pays up?

OK, so we’re back at the roadside, and the paramedic drone has finally arrived. The bleeding has stopped, you’re lucid once again, and you’re ready to tackle the issue of compensation. You didn’t crash your car; your car crashed itself – who is paying up?

“In criminal law and in civil law, the issue is who is in control of the vehicle,” Matthew Claxson, a road injury lawyer at Slater & Gordon, tells me. “So the operator could say, ‘Well, I was reading a newspaper and relied upon the computer to take control of the journey,’ and there would be an argument that the manufacturer of the car would have the liability. Whether they pursue further claims against software manufacturers remains to be seen.”

Related: Apple CarPlay vs Android Auto

If a car part – like a gearbox, for instance – fails in the UK today, Claxson explains, and the fault was the result of dodgy manufacturing, and that car goes on to kill someone, the estates of the person who died would “usually sue the car driver,” or the car operator in the case of a driverless car. The driver’s insurance company then settles the claim, but would then go on to pursue a further action against the car manufacturer “behind the scenes, to recover their loss.”

“It’s one of the advantages of the UK insurance policy that it gives recourse to those who have been seriously injured or killed to a financial settlement that can either assist with the medical treatment, or pay for the funeral costs, or assist the bereaved families in some way,” says Claxson.

But there’s one issue that throws a spanner in the works, and that’s hacking. Earlier this year, it was discovered that the Mitsubishi Outlander hybrid could be controlled by hackers thanks to a vulnerability in the car’s on-board Wi-Fi system. And more recently, Fiat Chrysler had to issue a voluntary recall for 1.4 million vehicles after a hack that could kill the engine remotely was discovered.

Driverless cars could be hacked and crashed – so who pays up then?

So if a driverless car kills somebody because it’s been hacked, then it doesn’t seem fair to pin liability on the driver or the car maker. In that case, who pays up? Claxson suggests the following solution:

“We have a process in this country where if a car is stolen, and it kills or causes injury to somebody, then that thief disappears (i.e. it’s a hit-and-run), we have an organisation known as the Motor Insurers Bureau, which is a fund of last resort that’s set up by the Secretary of Transport in this country. That would step in for those hit-and-run victims and compensate them if they are the innocent party.”

He continues: “One would hope to see a similar mechanism like that in the future, that if a car is hacked and it’s not the fault of the manufacturer or driver, you would hope there would be a similar fund to assist those victims.”

Driverless cars are a liability nightmare

The message here is simple: It’s pretty easy to assign liability when cars are fully autonomous. And even in the case of hacking, compensation can still be paid out. But what happens when a car isn’t fully autonomous, and the driver can still control the vehicle?

After all, when Joshua Brown died after his car’s sensors failed earlier this year, Tesla quickly reminded us of its advice that Autopilot “is an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times.” Tesla also added: “Autopilot is getting better all the time, but it is not perfect and still requires the driver to remain alert.”

The starting point is working out exactly how autonomous a vehicle is. There are plenty of different methods to do this, but the most popular (so far, anyway) is the SAE system, which has six different levels of vehicle automation:

Level 0 – No Automation – The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of driving

Level 1 – Driver Assistance – The driving mode-specific execution of accelerating, decelerating, or steering, using information about the environment

Level 2 – Partial Automation – The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration

Level 3 – Conditional Automation – Performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the driving task, with the expectation that a human driver will respond to a request to intervene

Level 4 – High Automation – The performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of driving, even if a human driver doesn’t respond to a request to intervene

Level 5 – Full Automation – The full-time performance by an automated driving system of the entire driving task, under all road and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver

Even new cars aren’t hitting level 5 autonomy yet, and there are plenty of cars on the road that still haven’t made it past level 0. That means that under existing law, if your car has an accident because you didn’t have your hands on the wheel, even in a semi-autonomous car, you’re almost certainly liable, at least according to Adrian Armstrong, of the Collision Investigation team at forensics firm Keith Borer Consultants:

“Currently, it’s the driver’s fault. All of the safety features that are added, take the Tesla for example, are designed to be an addition to the driver’s input. They are not supposed to replace the driver’s awareness.”

But as the Tesla case has proved, as cars become more autonomous, it becomes significantly more difficult to assign liability.

The UK Department of Transport currently suggests that liability for a vehicle in autonomous mode rests with the car maker, but when the driver has regained control, the driver should assume liability instead.

The problem is that it’s tough for drivers to stay mentally engaged when they’re not physically engaged, which makes that ‘handover’ period difficult to resolve in terms of liability. Some studies have shown that it can take as long as 35 to 40 seconds for drivers to take effective control of a car when switching back from autonomous mode.

Insurance companies are (unsurprisingly) very keen to crack the matter of liability with awkward situations like the handover dilemma. One insurance firm that’s already making significant headway in the space is AXA, as Daniel O’Byrne, the company’s Public Affairs Manager for the UK, explains:

“We are a partner in three of the government-funded trials that are looking to bring driverless or connected or autonomous vehicles to fruition. We’re taking the modified Bowler Wildcat, which is already capable of being driven under remote control, and was developed militarily by BAE. We’re trying to take it to the next level with the sensors and the decision-making process, and where we come in is looking at that from an insurance liability perspective.”

O’Byrne says that the company is particularly interested in how liability is assigned during the handover period. After all, he tells me the government “eventually wants you to be able to read a book or check e-mails on an iPad”, adding: “I’d be very surprised if by 2020, you can’t just press a button in your car and start reading a book.” But that is a huge problem, because it means the “driver” isn’t paying attention to the road environment:

“If the car hands over control to the human, how long is it reasonable to allow that driver to assume liability again? Can a driver go from reading a book to driving at X miles an hour in five seconds? That’s probably unreasonable. We are looking at that behavioural aspect, the universities are looking at the psychology, and how people react to that handover.”

Watch: Autonomous liability debated

Unlike in the US, there’s no law in the UK that says you have to keep your hands on the wheel. What we have in Britain is the Road Traffic Act, which only compels drivers to pay “due care and attention.” That sounds like frustratingly broad phrasing, but O’Byrne believes this ambiguity could actually give the UK an advantage against other countries when it comes to building a legislative framework.

“We were signatories to, but not ratifiers of, the Vienna Convention,” says O’Byrne, referencing the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which says that drivers must always keep their hands on the wheel. “And, in a nutshell, whilst the Road Traffic Act says you have to pay due care and attention, we are not as prescriptive as other countries saying that you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times, which potentially allows us an easier change in the law than, say, Germany.”

The Venturer Consortium, which is the driverless car trial group that AXA is part of, is currently testing driver’s performance during the handover process in different scenarios. The results of this trial are going to be extremely useful in working out who is liable, and will hopefully reveal how long a driver reasonably has to regain full control of a vehicle.

Once the insurance companies and legislators come to a joint conclusion on this, it should be easier to set a standard length of time for drivers to regain control of a driverless vehicle. That should make it significantly easier to determine who’s liable, because the switchover from autonomous systems to driver control can easily be tracked on a software level. And that means assigning blame is almost as easy as it is today.

Are driverless cars worth all this effort?

Let’s be fair: When industry giants like Tesla, Google, and Ford tell you that we’ll be safer with driverless cars, they’re absolutely right. As cars begin to rely less on human input, fewer humans will die on roads.

According to OECD data, a fatality occurs once for every 53.4 million miles driven by cars, as an average across 20 EU countries sampled. In the United States, better-than-average road safety standards reduce that figure to one fatality per 94 million miles. But already, over 130 million miles have been driven with Tesla’s Autopilot activated, with just a single fatality on the books.

Part of the allure of driverless cars is the fact that it snuffs out human error, which AXA believes accounts for 94% of all driving accidents. The CDC says over 30% of road fatalities in the United States involve alcohol. And in the United Kingdom, the Department for Transport puts that figure at around one in six. If we wake up tomorrow and every car is autonomous, drink driving disappears overnight.

It gets even better: According to the Eno Centre for Transportation, if 90% of all vehicles on the roads in the US were autonomous, the number of road accidents would fall from 5.5 million per year to just 1.3 million. That future is not so distant either, with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predicting that by 2040, around 75% of all vehicles will be fully autonomous.

The biggest challenge to driverless cars going mainstream is getting the public on side. Without proper solutions for the issues around ethics and liability, public opinion is sure to stay frosty for the foreseeable future.

Car makers can talk up the technology until they’re blue in the face, but if a manufacturer can’t tell a grieving wife why her husband’s hatchback just drove him off a cliff – or even cough up the compensation – then driverless cars will probably be passenger-less too.

Would you welcome a driverless car future? Tell us your thoughts by tweeting us @TrustedReviews.. . Consumer-safety advocates and autonomous-vehicle experts criticized Tesla Inc. for issuing another statement about the death of a customer that pinned the blame on driver inattentiveness.

Days after publishing a second blog post about the crash involving Walter Huang, a 38-year-old who died last month in his Model X, Tesla issued a statement in response to his family speaking with San Francisco television station ABC7. The company said the “only” explanation for the crash was “if Mr. Huang was not paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.”

“I find it shocking,” Cathy Chase, president of the group Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said by phone. “They’re claiming that the only way for this accident to have occurred is for Mr. Huang to be not paying attention. Where do I start? That’s not the only way.”

Groups including Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and Consumer Reports have criticized Tesla for years for naming its driver-assistance system Autopilot, with the latter calling on the company to choose a different moniker back in July 2016. The two organizations share the view of the National Transportation Safety Board, which has urged carmakers to do more to ensure drivers using partially autonomous systems like Autopilot remain engaged with the task of driving. The U.S. agency is in the midst of two active investigations into Autopilot-related crashes.

It’s Tesla’s responsibility to provide adequate safeguards against driver misuse of Autopilot, including by sending visual and audible warnings when the system needs a human to take back over, Chase said. “If they’re not effective in getting someone to re-engage -- as they say that their drivers have to -- then they’re not doing their job.”

High Stakes



The stakes for Tesla’s bid to defend Autopilot are significant. The NTSB’s investigation of the March 23 crash involving Huang contributed to a major selloff in the company’s shares late last month. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk claimed almost 18 months ago that the system will eventually render Tesla vehicles capable of full self-driving, and much of the value of the $51 billion company is linked to views that it could be an autonomous-car pioneer.

Tesla has declined to say how long drivers can now use Autopilot between visual or audible warnings to have a hand on the wheel. It’s also refused to comment on how many alerts can be ignored before the system disengages, what version of Autopilot software was in Huang’s Model X, or when the car was built.

“Just because a driver does something stupid doesn’t mean they -- or others who are truly blameless -- should be condemned to an otherwise preventable death,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina’s School of Law, who studies driverless-car regulations. “One might consider whether there are better ways to prevent drivers from hurting themselves or, worse, others.”

Under Investigations



The NTSB is looking into the crash that killed Huang, as well as a collision in January involving a Tesla Model S that rear-ended a fire truck parked on a freeway near Los Angeles with Autopilot engaged. The agency said after Tesla’s second blog post about the Huang incident that it was unhappy with the company for disclosing details during its investigation.

In its latest statement, Tesla said it is “extremely clear” that Autopilot requires drivers to be alert and have hands on the steering wheel. The system reminds the driver this every time it’s engaged, according to the company.

“Tesla’s response is reflective of its ongoing strategy of doubling down on the explicit warnings it has given to drivers on how to use, and not use, the system,” said Mike Ramsey, an analyst at Gartner Inc. “It’s not the first time Tesla has taken this stance.”

Huang’s wife told ABC7 he had complained before the fatal crash that his Model X had steered toward the same highway barrier he collided with on March 23. The family has hired Minami Tamaki LLP, which said in a statement Wednesday that it believes Tesla’s Autopilot is defective and likely caused Huang’s death. The San Francisco-based law firm declined to comment on Tesla’s statement.

Crash-Rate Claim



The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has the power to order recalls and fine auto manufacturers, found no defect after investigating the May 2016 crash involving a Tesla Model S driven on Autopilot by Josh Brown, a former Navy SEAL. The agency closed its probe in January 2017.

According to data Tesla gave NHTSA investigators prior to its decision against any recall, Autopilot’s steering system may prevent the rate of crashes per million miles driven by about 40 percent, a figure the company cited in its latest statement.

“We empathize with Mr. Huang’s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,” Tesla said. “The reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.”

Neither Tesla nor NHTSA has released the underlying data to support the crash-rate reduction claim.

“Tesla explicitly uses data gathered from its vehicles to protect itself, even if it means going after its own customers,” said Ramsey, the Gartner analyst.

by Dana Hull, Ryan Beene and Keith Naughton. On Sunday night, a self-driving car operated by Uber struck and killed a pedestrian, 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, on North Mill Avenue in Tempe, Arizona. It appears to be the first time an automobile driven by a computer has killed a human being by force of impact. The car was traveling at 38 miles per hour.

An initial investigation by Tempe police indicated that the pedestrian might have been at fault. According to that report, Herzberg appears to have come “from the shadows,” stepping off the median into the roadway, and ending up in the path of the car while jaywalking across the street. The National Transportation Safety Board has also opened an investigation. It’s still hard to know exactly what took place, at this time, without some speculation.

Likewise, it’s difficult to evaluate what this accident means for the future of autonomous cars. Crashes, injuries, and fatalities were a certainty as driverless vehicles began moving from experiment to reality. In 2016, a Tesla operating in its unique “autopilot” mode in Florida crashed into a tractor-trailer that made a left turn in front of the vehicle, killing the Tesla’s driver. At the time, it was the first known fatality from a self-driving vehicle—but at the time of the accident, the car had apparently been warning its driver to disengage the autopilot mode and take control of the vehicle.

Advocates of autonomy tend to cite overall improvements to road safety in a future of self-driving cars. Ninety-four percent of car crashes are caused by driver error, and both fully and partially autonomous cars could improve that number substantially—particularly by reducing injury and death from speeding and drunk driving. Even so, crashes, injuries, and fatalities will hardly disappear when and if self-driving cars are ubiquitous. Robocars will crash into one another occasionally and, as the incident in Tempe illustrates, they will collide with pedestrians and bicyclists, too. Overall, eventually, those figures will likely number far fewer than the 37,461 people who were killed in car crashes in America in 2016.

The problem is, that result won’t be accomplished all at once, but in spurts as autonomous technology rolls out. During that period, which could last decades, the social and legal status of robocar safety will rub up against existing standards, practices, and sentiments. A fatality like the one in Tempe this week seems different because it is different. Instead of a vehicle operator failing to see and respond to a pedestrian in the road, a machine operating the vehicle failed to interpret the signals its sensors received and process them in a
