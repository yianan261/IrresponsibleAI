We have in the past seen instances such as the failure of Microsoft bot Tay, when it developed a tendency to come up with racist remarks. Within 24 hours of its existence and interaction with people, it starting sending offensive comments, and went from “humans are super cool” to being almost a Nazi.

While on one hand, chatbots, robots and conversational platforms are finding their niche in many companies, these technological advancements are also turning mainstream to become the face of the company. But many times they end up failing and disappointing us. While most of the times these technologies fail because companies don’t clearly define their purpose, others could be pure technical glitches.

Here we list some of the tech failures from last year that hint that the companies need to work harder and keep coming up with better and improved versions of their innovations.

1. When Facebook’s Chatbots Developed Their Own Language

As scary as it may sound, “Bob” and “Alice”, the chatbots created by Facebook had to be shut down as the duo started communicating in their own language, defying human generated algorithms.

The bots were originally developed to learn how to negotiate, by mimicking human trading and bartering, but when they were paired to trade against each other, they started to learn their own bizarre form of communication. Though they were designed to communicate in English, they developed their own mysterious language that humans couldn’t crack.

Bob: i can i i everything else . . . . . . . . . .

Alice: balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to

This is how their conversation looked like. Researchers stopped the operation of the chatbots citing that they were looking at bots that could behave differently.

2. When Mitra The Robot Failed To Greet The Prime Minister

The indigenously built robot called Mitra, developed by Bengaluru-based Invento Robotics walked up to welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ivanka Trump at the the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) opening in Hyderabad. While the robot was programmed to welcome each of them with their names on pressing the respective flags, it failed to do so.

When Modi was first requested to press Indian flag, Ivanka also ended up pressing the US flag simultaneously and because of the confusion due to overlapping, Mitra could not function properly.

This failure could be attributed to being poorly coded, where there was no specific instruction given to the robot to complete the current task before starting a new one. For instance, it kept on saying “Welcome miss Ivan, Welcome miss Ivan, Welcome Shri Narendra Modi”. The robot could not say Ivanka Trump’s full name because before it could complete the sentence, it received a new input, and gave a preference to newer requests.

3. When Autonomous And Driverless Vehicles Turned Disastrous

In a tragic incident involving Uber self driving car, a woman was killed during a trial, stalling autonomous vehicle operations worldwide. The car was travelling on a partially lit road, when a woman appeared out of nowhere in the darkness. The Uber self driving Volvo which was driving at a speed of 61 kmph, failed to apprehend the same and resulted in a fateful crash.

Back in India, Delhi’s first ever driverless metro met with an accident during its trial, and it was touted to be human error and negligence. Reportedly, the trial train was moved to testing from the workshop without testing the brake, as a result of which the moving train hit the adjacent boundary wall, with no harm to lives.

4. When iPhone X’s Face Recognition Could Not Differentiate Identical Twins

When Apple released its iPhone X with much aplomb, it was awed for its artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. Facial recognition was one of the key capabilities that it boasted, but it was found to have a weakness for identical twins.

When Apple unveiled the Face ID in September, it did warn that its acceptance rate might be somewhat lower if presented with two people with very similar DNA, aka identical twins, it could be speculated that Face ID wasn’t perfect. Face ID, a face mapping technology that can unlock phones, verify Apple Pay and replace fingerprint scanners, could be fooled at some level, especially when identical twins are made to use the Face ID.

That’s not all, a week after the phone’s release, Vietnamese security firm Bkav, using a mask with 3D printed base, convinced the phone that it was human and made the phone to unlock itself. The firm said that it cost merely $150 to create the mask, and hinted towards a possible hacker’s attack in the future.

5. When Alexa And Amazon Echo Goofed Up

The popular Amazon Echo cost one of its owners a huge locksmith bill, when police had to break down the house on complaints from neighbours of loud music early in the morning. Amazon Echo, which comes with robust and smart speakers accidentally activated itself and blasted music, when the residents were out.

In another instance, Amazon Alexa, a virtual assistant that has made lives of many easier, placed an order for $170 dollhouse, when a six-year-old asked for one.

On A Concluding Note

Though there have been stunning developments in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics over the years, these failures suggest that there is a lot more to achieve. The companies increasingly need to rewire their DNA and bring better features and innovations to ensure an unmistakable customer experience. While general intelligence is a far reaching goal for AI, botification has the power to bring convenience at a much faster pace, if they are 100 percent successful.. Delhi Metro's Magenta Line is to run between Janakpuri in Delhi and neighbouring Noida.

Highlights Delhi Metro blames "human error, negligence", orders high-level inquiry

Crash took place because the train's brakes were disengaged

Magenta line will slash travel between south Delhi and Noida to 19 mins

A driverless Delhi Metro train being tested on a new "Magenta Line" crashed through a wall this afternoon, just days before its launch by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Christmas. No one was hurt in the crash, which allegedly took place because the train's brakes were disengaged. The Delhi Metro has blamed it on "human error and negligence" and has ordered a high-level inquiry.Two coaches were badly damaged after the train, which was empty, went through a wall at the Kalindi Kunj depot and barely missed crashing to the ground. The incident took place around 3.40 pm."A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall," the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement.

The Delhi Metro says it appears to be a case of human error

In photos, a portion of the engine jutted out of the wall of the station.Officials said at the workshop, the brakes of a train are usually disengaged so its systems can be checked thoroughly. The brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff before the train left the shed. "It appears this was not done...the person who took charge of the train did not check the brake...Without the brakes, the train rolled back when it was being taken on a washing ramp," the statement said.PM Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the Kalkaji Mandir-Botanical Garden stretch of the Magenta line, which is to run between Delhi and Noida. The Magenta line promises to slash travel between south Delhi and Noida to just 19 minutes.The 12.64-km section was granted safety approval just last month.Delhi Metro's Managing Director Mangu Singh said operations on the Magenta Line were "absolutely safe", with a high level of automation."Today's incident was manual error during maintenance and has nothing to do with the trials or passenger safety during future operations," said Mr Singh.The new Metro line will have automated platform screen doors at every station, just like jubilee line of the London tube, say officials.. About a month after being granted safety approval by the commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS), an unmanned Delhi Metro train on the yet-to-be-inaugurated Magenta Line derailed, crashing into a wall.

The incident happened during a trial run on the line which, once completed, will connect Botanical Garden with Janakpuri West, covering a distance of 38.23km.

The first section of the Magenta Line, connecting Botanical Garden with Kalkaji, will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25.

This accident comes at a time when excitement around the new generation driverless trains is rising. However, the latest incident may serve as a setback for now. The thought of riding on driverless trains in a country where public safety is often the last on the list of priorities for authorities was, in any case, enough to scare the daylights out of most commuters.

This accident, the reasons for which remain a matter of investigation, may further delay the introduction of the unmanned trains.

Driverless trains have been a part of public transport in many developed countries for some time now. In India, the idea took flight in the summer of 2015 when the first driverless six-coach train arrived in New Delhi from South Korea.

By the end of 2015, 20 such six-coach train sets were manufactured by Hyundai Rotem, a South Korea-based company.

DMRC's new generation driverless trains, to begin with, will run between Botanical Garden and Kalkaji, where an advanced Communication Based Train Control signalling technology, facilitating movement of trains with a frequency of 90-100 seconds, will be pressed into service.

According to the existing plan, initially, drivers are going to be deputed in these trains to ensure smooth operation. However, gradually, they will be withdrawn, moving to unattended train operations. While the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has confirmed the incident, it has clarified there is no need to panic. But it will be difficult for passengers not to panic when they actually hop on the train knowing it is unmanned, especially in the backdrop of today's (December 19) accident.

The Metro staff is currently exploring technical reasons to ascertain the reason for the derailment. About 30 lakh people use the Metro in the national capital region every day to travel to work, meet friends or just get home. That's too big a number to take lightly.. A Metro train on a new line, to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week, hit a wall here on Tuesday evening during trials as its brakes failed, a Delhi Metro official said. No one was injured.

The incident, on the upcoming section between Noida and Kalkalji, occurred at 3.40 p.m. at the Kalindi Kunj Metro Depot due to brake failure, the Delhi Metro said.

"A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall," said the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) statement.

In a video grab of the incident which has since gone viral, the train can be seen coming out from the other side of the wall of the depot after hitting it.

Attributing the incident to "human error", the DMRC said it appeared to have occurred because the brakes were not checked properly after the train was taken off the signalling system by the person who was in charge of the train.

It said once the train enters the workshop, it is taken off the signal system and brakes are properly checked before it is put back in operation.

"Prima facie, it appears, this was not done and subsequently, the person who took charge of the train from the maintenance staff also did not check the brake and proceeded with the train up to the washing plant built on a ramp. While stopping at the ramp, since the brakes were not available, the train rolled back causing this incident," it said.

The DMRC added that though the trains on the upcoming Magenta Line are enabled to be driven without drivers, at the time of the incident inside the workshop, it was being manually operated since it was off the signal system.



"DMRC has ordered a high level enquiry into this incident by a committee of three officers... Prima facie it appears to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry," it added.

Modi is to inaugurate a section (Botanical Garden - Kalkaji Mandir) on the line on December 25.



Delhi Govt seeks report from DMRC on train crash during trial



The Delhi government has sought a report from the DMRC after a train crashed during a trial run on the magenta line that was scheduled to be inaugurated by the prime minister next week.



There can be no compromise on passenger safety, Delhi Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said while seeking report from the the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).



"I have sought a report from DMRC on the derailment of its driverless train during trial run on Kalkaji-botanical Garden. Shocking lapse ! There can be no compromise on passenger safety," Gahlot tweeted.

. New Delhi: A driverless Delhi Metro train on the Magenta line on Monday crashed into a wall during a trial run at Kalindi Kunj depot in the city.

The accident occurred at 3.40 PM (1540hrs) at the Kalindi Kunj Metro depot, said DMRC. There were, however, no casualties.

The DMRC asserted it will have no bearing on December 25 launch, which is to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall. No person was injured in the incident," read a statement from DMRC.

The Managing Director of DMRC, Mangu Singh, has ordered a high level enquiry into this incident by a committee of three officers of the rank of Executive Directors.

"Prima facie, it appears to be a case of human error and negligence and appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry," read the statement from DMRC.

Mangu Singh, said that "main line operations on this line are absolutely safe, with a high level of automation and has been thoroughly checked and cleared by the commissioner of metro rail safety for passenger operations "

"Today's incident was a manual error during maintenance and has nothing to do with the trials or passenger safety during future operations," he said.

The Delhi government, meanwhile, also sought a report from the DMRC on the incident with Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot tweeting: "Shocking lapse! There can be no compromise on passenger safety."

The DMRC and the Delhi government are engaged in a running feud over the recent rise in commuting fares. The Arvind Kejriwal government continues to insist that the fare hike should be rolled back.

The first leg of the project that is being inaugurated this Christmas was scheduled to be operational by December 2015. Trial runs between the Kalindi Kunj and Kalkaji Mandir section of the Magenta Line started in August 2016.

Phase 4 of the Delhi Metro is also caught in delays. The cost required is likely to increase by Rs 6,000 crore as the Centre and the Delhi government are yet to decide whether Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will be the funding agency or not. Additionally, DMRC will have to prepare detailed project reports afresh for the new phase by involving private players, mandated under the new Metro policy.

A spokesperson of DMRC said that 2500-3000 people travel on a single Metro. The 12.64-km section, part of metro's upcoming Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West (Magenta) Line, was granted safety approval by the Commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) last month.

Metro's new generation trains, which can run without drivers, will operate on this section where an advanced Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling technology that will facilitate movement of trains with a frequency of 90 to 100 seconds will also be pressed into service.

However, for an initial period of two-three years the trains will have drivers.

Currently, those travelling to south Delhi have to change have to change trains at Mandi House Metro Station.

After the new section is opened, commuters will be able to travel directly to Kalkaji Mandir Metro Station, which is on the Violet Line, cutting travel time by about 45 minutes.

Once the entire corridor from Botanical Garden till Janakpuri West (38.23 km) is operational, commuters from Noida will be able to go to Gurgaon by changing trains at Hauz Khas.

The Botanical Garden station has been developed as Delhi Metro's first-ever inter-change station outside the boundaries of Delhi.

The route has nine stations: Kalkaji Mandir, Okhla NSIC, Sukhdev Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Jasola Vihar, Shaheen Bagh, Kalindi Kunj, Okhla Bird Sanctuary and Botanical Garden.. “This part of the depot is for maintenance of trains and without power for trains. Trains are pulled by a shunter engine and therefore this area is not controlled by signaling system. Accordingly, the train was doing local shunting in this part with a person on board and was not ‘driverless’. Such an operation would not affect the main line operations in any way whatsoever where public would be carried eventually,” Dayal said.. A driverless metro train on a trial run in New Delhi crashed through the wall of the Kalindi Kunj depot in South Delhi on Tuesday, ANI reported.

The mishap comes just days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the Delhi Metro’s Kalkaji Mandir-Botanical Garden line on Christmas Day. Unmanned trains will ply on the route in about two to three years, NDTV reported.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said the accident occurred because the maintenance team did not check the train’s brakes before the trial run. The metro authority has ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident, saying a committee of three of its officers will look into it.

The corporation said the train was being operated manually when it was taken to the Kalindi Kunj depot to be washed. When the operator moved the train up a ramp, it slid backwards because the brakes were not working.

Kalkaji Mandir is a station on the Violet Line in South Delhi, and Botanical Garden is located on the metro’s Blue Line in Noida. The new line, known as the Magenta Line, will reduce the travel time between South Delhi and Noida.

The first phase of the 12.64-km-long Magenta Line will have nine stations – Botanical Garden, Okhla Bird Sanctuary, Kalindi Kunj, Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh, Ohla Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir..

On Tuesday afternoon, Delhi Metro’s driverless train rammed into a boundary wall after the authorities failed to check the brake systems. The incident took place at 3:40 pm at the Kalindi Kunj depot. Nobody was injured in the crash, but the pictures from the accident went viral on the internet. Soon after the accident, Twitter was bombarded with hilarious memes made out of the viral picture. Check them out.

PM Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the Kalkaji Mandir-Botanical Garden stretch of the Magenta Line, which will run between Delhi and Noida. The authorities have blamed the accident on human negligence and a high-level inquiry is ordered on the matter.

"A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall," the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement.

Ideally, the brake system of the train should’ve been tested before sending it for the trial. "It appears this was not done...the person who took charge of the train did not check the brake...Without the brakes, the train rolled back when it was being taken on a washing ramp," the statement said.

Delhi Metro's Managing Director Mangu Singh said operations on the Magenta Line were "absolutely safe", with a high level of automation. "Today's incident was manual error during maintenance and has nothing to do with the trials or passenger safety during future operations," said Mr Singh.. A driverless train on the New Delhi Metro has crashed during test run, with a carriage plowing through a depot wall. An inquiry has been launched, with metro officials citing "human error" as the main cause of the incident.

The new automatically-operated train was being tested on Delhi's Magenta Line on Tuesday. At some point its brakes became disengaged, and the train rolled and crashed into a station wall, local media reports. As a result, it plowed through the wall, "barely missing crashing to the ground," according to NDTV.

Despite the incident, the launch will go ahead as planned, metro officials said.. Driverless Delhi metro train rams into wall | Photo Credit: Times Now

New Delhi: In a shocking incident, a driverless train of the Delhi Metro took off and rammed into a wall during the trial run of the new Botanical Garden-Kalkaji Magenta line. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to inaugurate the new metro line on December 25 - but the event itself is under question.

The Delhi government has sought a report from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, said Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot.

The driverless train, which took off from the new Botanical Garden, broke through boundary at Kalindi Kunj depot. Initial investigation suggests the train did not stop after the automated brakes on the train failed.

A special feature is that the new line will also have 'driverless trains'. Initially, drivers will run the trains and only after stringent trials, the ‘unattended train operations’ will commence. However, the first trial run has ended in a mishap.

After the accident, the Delhi Metro Rail Cooperation has issued a statement explaining why the incident took place and stating that a high-level enquiry has been ordered into the incident. The statement adds that this appears to be a "case of human error and negligence" and that appropriate action will be taken after the enquiry.

"A trial train was moved from the workshop without testing the brake system as a result of which, while the train was moving up the ramp for washing, it rolled back and hit the adjacent boundary wall. No person was injured in the incident," the statement said.

"As per normal procedure prescribed, when a train enters the workshop, the brakes of the train are decommissioned so that the train and its systems including the brakes can be freely checked. As per procedure, once the train is again re-commissioned, the brakes should have been tested by the maintenance staff in the depot before the train left the shed. The train movement inside the workshop area is done manually and not by the signalling system. Prima facie, it appears, this was not done and subsequently, the person who took charge of the train from the maintenance staff also did not check the brake and proceeded with the train up to the washing plant built on a ramp. While stopping at the ramp, since the brakes were not available, the train rolled back causing this incident," the statement added.

The line had, in fact, gone through a safety inspection -- considered the last step before the start of the operation -- during November 13 to 15, and was expected to commence operations later that month.

However, according to informed sources, the inauguration was put on hold due to various bureaucratic reasons, one of them being the selection of a personality to perform the opening.

The new line is expected to reduce the travel time taken from Noida to South Delhi almost two hours. It is expected the travel time of commuters between Botanical Garden and Kalkaji from the existing 52 minutes (Botanical Garden to Mandi House via Blue Line and onwards to Kalkaji on Violet Line) to a direct 19 minutes.
